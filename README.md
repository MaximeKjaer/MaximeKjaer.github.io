# Imperative

**Imperative** is a clean and simple Jekyll blog that won't take you more than two minutes to set up.

- You can host your blog for free right here on GitHub.
- You don't need to install anything :relieved:
- It just takes a few clicks to try out, and you can always delete your forked repository if you don't like it!
- Again &mdash; it's *really* easy, trust me! :relaxed:

<!-- Insert images and demo here!! -->

## Quick Start
### 1. Fork Imperative to your account

Fork the repo, and then rename it to `yourGitHubUsername.github.io`.

At this point, your blog is actually already live over at [yourgithubusername.github.io](http://yourgithubusername.github.io)!

### 2. Customize your site
The [_config.yml](/_config.yml) file is where the basic customization is happening. Here are some of the things that you can do:

- Change your name
- Change your description
- Enable Google Analytics
- Enable Disqus comments
- Change the blog's URL structure
- Change the pagination of your blog
- And much more to come!

### 3. Write your first blog post!
You can edit the file in the [_posts](/_posts/) folder to publish your first blog post.

There are a few formatting rules for blog posts, which I will describe somewhere before publishing this repo.

- [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) &ndash; Thanks to [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and all contributors. Jekyll Now is the project that gave me the idea for this theme in the first place, and you'll still find a few snippets of their code in this repo (this README is inspired by their work too, really!).
