Hello! My name is Maxime Kjaer, and I'm an 19-year-old Computer Science student. Originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, I'm now living in Switzerland and studying at the EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

When I'm not studying or programming, I like running, reading, skiing, Skyping with my family back at home and listening to music.

Introductions aside, the goal of this site is to be an outlet for my thoughts, ideas and work, should anyone want to read into that.

You can shoot me an email at [maxime.kjaer@gmail.com](mailto:maxime.kjaer@gmail.com) anytime you want! [Here's my PGP key]({{ site.baseurl }}/Maxime_Kjaer_pub.asc), should you wish to use it.

I also read my university email, [maxime.kjaer@epfl.ch](mailto:maxime.kjaer@epfl.ch).
