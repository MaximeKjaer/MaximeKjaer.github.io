Hello! My name is Maxime Kjaer, and I'm a 22-year-old Computer Science student. Originally from Copenhagen, Denmark, I'm now living in Switzerland and studying at the EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

I'm fascinated by everything that has to do with technology, science and programming. When I'm not working with that, I'm usually [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/8353205) or [listening to music](https://soundcloud.com/maxime-kjaer).

Introductions aside, the goal of this site is to be an outlet for my thoughts, ideas and work, should anyone want to read into that.

You can shoot me an email at [maxime.kjaer@gmail.com](mailto:maxime.kjaer@gmail.com) anytime you want! All my public profiles and PGP keys are on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/mkjaer), so check that out if you'd like to get in touch.
