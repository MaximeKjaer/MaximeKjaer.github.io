title: Free hardware for beta testers is a bad idea
published: false

Finding beta testers is no easy business, and today's Kickstarter launch of the [Jide Remix Ultra-Tablet] is just proof of that;

The Remix is a device that aims to bridge the gap between laptops and tablets. Now, I understand that this idea is far from being revolutionary. After all, a lot of smaller and bigger names have tried to do that with varying success. Many people have called the Remix OS a Surface rip-off, but what they don't see is that the guys behind it are actually doing the complete opposite of Microsoft!

I liked the idea in [this video](https://youtu.be/iSmkqocn0oQ?t=30s) of approaching the same ideal from different angles, and I think that the idea applies to this case too. Microsoft and Jibe are each trying to get to the same place, but do so in a different way: while MS are coming from a background of low portability and high functionality, the Remix OS is coming from a highly portable OS with less functionality, and I think that this (more or less) novel approach shouldn't be overlooked!

Now, full disclosure: I did manage to get into the 39$ tier, so I may be biased, but I'd honestly like to think that my views still would've held up if I hadn't gotten it.

Because the matter of the fact is that it almost angers me to see so many people lash out at the guys behind the tablet just because they didn't get one: Facebook and reddit went from messages of support and excitement to being absolutely riddled with insults and criticism.

I'm absolutely sick and tired of people's behavior when it comes to free stuff. It brings out the worst in people. Politeness and correctness are very swiftly exchanged with aggressivity and rudeness when it comes to things like that.


- give it a spin
- give a new spin to what a tablet should be.
