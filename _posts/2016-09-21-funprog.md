## Books
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, MIT Press
- Programming in Scala, Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners, 2nd edition, Artima 2010

## Call-by-name (CBN), call-by-value (CBV)
Let's say we have the following function, and that we call it in the following way:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def test(x: Int, y: int) = x * x

test(3+4, 2)
{% endhighlight %}

There are 2 strategies to solving this: send the function the uncalculated arguments (CBN) or calculate the arguments and *then* send them to the function (CBV). 


- CBN and CBV reduce an expression to the same value as long as both evaluations terminate.
- If CBV evaluation of an expression *e* terminates, then CBN evaluation of *e* terminates too
- The other direction is not true.

Here's an example:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def first(x: Int, y: Int) = x
def loop: Int = loop

first(1, loop) // reduces to 1 under CBN since loop isn't run
first(1, loop) // does not terminate under CBV
{% endhighlight %}

Scala normally uses CBV, but you can force CBN with the `=>`.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def contOne(x: Int, y: => Int) = 1

def or(x: Boolean, y: => Boolean) = if (x) y else false // we need to return y as a value, not a function.
{% endhighlight %}

### Value definitions
Using `def` is CBN, but `val` is CBV.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
val x = 2 // x refers to 2
val y = square(x) // y refers to 4, and not the function square(x)

def x = loop // OK
val x = loop // does not terminate since loop is evaluated
{% endhighlight %}


## Blocks and lexical scope
To avoid namespace pollution, we can use nested functions:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def sqrt(x: Double) = {
    def sqrtIter(guess: Double): Double =
        if (isGoodEnough(guess)) guess
        else sqrtIter(improve(guess))

    def isGoodEnough(guess: Double) =
        abs(guess * guess - x) / x < 0.001

    def improve(guess: Double) =
        (guess + x / guess) / 2

    sqrtIter(1.0)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is done using a block, delimited by `{ ... }` braces. The last element of a block is an expression that defines its return value.

The definitions inside a block are only visible from within the block. The block has access to what's been defined outside of it, but if it redefines an external definition, the new one will *shadow* the old one, meaning it will be redefined inside the block.

## Tail recursion
If a function calls itself as its last action, then the function's stack frame can be reused. This is called *tail recursion*. In practice, this means that recursion is iterative in Scala, and is just as efficient as a loop.

One can require that a function is tail-recursive using a `@tailrec` annotation:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
@tailrec
def gcd(a: Int, b:Int): Int = ...
{% endhighlight %}

An error is issued if `gcd` isn't tail recursive.

## Higher-Order Functions
Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions as results are called *higher order functions*, as opposed to a *first order function* that acts on simple data types.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
// Higher order function
// Corresponds to the sum of f(n) from a to b
def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): =
    if (a > b) 0
    else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)

// Different functions f
def id(x: Int): Int = x
def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x

// Calling our higher order function
def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(id, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(cube, a, b)
{% endhighlight %}

### Anonymous functions
Instead of having to define a `cube` and `id` function in the example above, we can just write an anonymous function as such:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def sumInts(a: Int, b:Int): Int = sum(x => x, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(x => x*x*x, a, b)
{% endhighlight %}

## Currying
We can once more improve our `sum` function:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int = { // Higher order function
    def sumF(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
        if (a > b) 0
        else f(a) + sumF(a + 1, b)
    sumF // Returns another function
}

sum(cube)(1, 10) // equivalent to sumCubes

// Syntactic sugar:
def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
    if (a > b) 0 else f(a) + sum(f)(a+1, b)
{% endhighlight %}

*Function application associates to the left* so `sum(cube)(1, 10)` is equivalent to `(sum(cube))(1, 10)`.

The type of `sum` is `(Int => Int) => (Int, Int) => Int`. This should be read and understood as `(Int => Int) => ((Int, Int) => Int)` as *functional types associate to the right*.

## Classes: functions and data
In Scala, we use *classes* to define and create data structures:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def numer = x
    def denom = y
}

val x = new Rational(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}

This introduces two entities:

- A new *type* named `Rational`
- A *constructor* `Rational` to create elements of this type

### Methods
One can go further and also package functions operating on a data abstraction into the data abstraction itself. Such functions are called *methods*.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def numer = x 
    def denom = y

    def add(that: Rational) = 
        new Rational(
            numer * that.denom + that.numer * denom,
            denom * that.denom)

    override def toString = numer + "/" + denom
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Identifier

The identifier is alphanumeric (starting with a letter, followed by letters or numbers) xor symbolic (starting with a symbol, followed by other symbols). We can mix them by using an alphanumeric name, an underscore `_` and then a symbol.

Small practical trick: to define a `neg` function that returns the negation of a `Rational`, we can write:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    ...

    def unary_- : Rational = new Rational(-numer, denom) // space between - and : because : shouldn't be a part of the identifier.
}
{% endhighlight %}

The *precedence* of an operator is determined by its first character, in the following priority (from lowest to highest):

- All letters
- `|`
- `^`
- `&`
- `< >`
- `= !`
- `:`
- `+ -`
- `* / %`
- All other symbolic characters

#### Infix notation
Any method with a parameter can be used like an infix operator:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
r add s                            r.add(s)
r less s     /* in place of */     r.less(s)
r max s                            r.max(s)
{% endhighlight %}

### Constructors
Scala naturally executes the code in the class body as an implicit constructor, but there is a way to explicitly define more constructors if necessary:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def this(x: Int) = this(x, 1)

    def numer = x
    def denom = y
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Data abstraction
We can improve `Rational` by making it an irreducible fraction using the GCD:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    private def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if (b == 0) a else gcd(b, a % b)
    val numer = x / gcd(x, y) // Computed only once with a val
    val denom = y / gcd(x, y)

    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

There are obviously multiple ways of achieving this; the above code just shows one. The ability to choose different implementations of the data without affecting clients is called *data abstraction*.

### Assert and require
When calling the constructor, using a denominator of 0 will eventually lead to errors. There are two ways of imposing restrictions on the given constructor arguments:

- `require`, which throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it fails
- `assert`, which throws an `AssertionError` if it fails

This reflects a difference in intent:

- `require` is used to enforce a precondition on the caller of a function
- `assert` is used to check the code of the function itself

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    require(y != 0, "denominator must be non-zero")
    
    val root = sqrt(this)
    assert(root >= 0)
}
{% endhighlight %}
