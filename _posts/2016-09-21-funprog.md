## Books
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman, MIT Press
- Programming in Scala, Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon and Bill Venners, 2nd edition, Artima 2010

## Call-by-name (CBN), call-by-value (CBV)
Let's say we have the following function, and that we call it in the following way:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def test(x: Int, y: int) = x * x

test(3+4, 2)
{% endhighlight %}

There are 2 strategies to solving this: send the function the uncalculated arguments (CBN) or calculate the arguments and *then* send them to the function (CBV). 


- CBN and CBV reduce an expression to the same value as long as both evaluations terminate.
- If CBV evaluation of an expression *e* terminates, then CBN evaluation of *e* terminates too
- The other direction is not true.

Here's an example:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def first(x: Int, y: Int) = x
def loop: Int = loop

first(1, loop) // reduces to 1 under CBN since loop isn't run
first(1, loop) // does not terminate under CBV
{% endhighlight %}

Scala normally uses CBV, but you can force CBN with the `=>`.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def contOne(x: Int, y: => Int) = 1

def or(x: Boolean, y: => Boolean) = if (x) y else false // we need to return y as a value, not a function.
{% endhighlight %}

### Value definitions
Using `def` is CBN, but `val` is CBV.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
val x = 2 // x refers to 2
val y = square(x) // y refers to 4, and not the function square(x)

def x = loop // OK
val x = loop // does not terminate since loop is evaluated
{% endhighlight %}


## Blocks and lexical scope
To avoid namespace pollution, we can use nested functions:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def sqrt(x: Double) = {
    def sqrtIter(guess: Double): Double =
        if (isGoodEnough(guess)) guess
        else sqrtIter(improve(guess))

    def isGoodEnough(guess: Double) =
        abs(guess * guess - x) / x < 0.001

    def improve(guess: Double) =
        (guess + x / guess) / 2

    sqrtIter(1.0)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is done using a block, delimited by `{ ... }` braces. The last element of a block is an expression that defines its return value.

The definitions inside a block are only visible from within the block. The block has access to what's been defined outside of it, but if it redefines an external definition, the new one will *shadow* the old one, meaning it will be redefined inside the block.

## Tail recursion
If a function calls itself as its last action, then the function's stack frame can be reused. This is called *tail recursion*. In practice, this means that recursion is iterative in Scala, and is just as efficient as a loop.

One can require that a function is tail-recursive using a `@tailrec` annotation:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
@tailrec
def gcd(a: Int, b:Int): Int = ...
{% endhighlight %}

An error is issued if `gcd` isn't tail recursive.

## Higher-Order Functions
Functions that take other functions as parameters or that return functions as results are called *higher order functions*, as opposed to a *first order function* that acts on simple data types.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
// Higher order function
// Corresponds to the sum of f(n) from a to b
def sum(f: Int => Int, a: Int, b: Int): =
    if (a > b) 0
    else f(a) + sum(f, a + 1, b)

// Different functions f
def id(x: Int): Int = x
def cube(x: Int): Int = x * x * x

// Calling our higher order function
def sumInts(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(id, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(cube, a, b)
{% endhighlight %}

### Anonymous functions
Instead of having to define a `cube` and `id` function in the example above, we can just write an anonymous function as such:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def sumInts(a: Int, b:Int): Int = sum(x => x, a, b)
def sumCubes(a: Int, b: Int): Int = sum(x => x*x*x, a, b)
{% endhighlight %}

## Currying
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying):

> Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, each with a single argument.

Essentially, with currying we do the following transition:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def f(x: Int): Int = x + y
f(1, 2) // evaluates to 3

def curry(f: (Int, Int) => Int): Int => (Int => Int) = x => y => f(x, y)
curry(f) // evaluates to x => (y => x + y)
curry(f)(1) // evaluates to y => y + 1
curry(f)(1)(2) // evaluates to 3
{% endhighlight %}

Using currying, we can once more improve our `sum` function:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def sum(f: Int => Int): (Int, Int) => Int = { // Higher order function
    def sumF(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
        if (a > b) 0
        else f(a) + sumF(a + 1, b)
    sumF // Returns another function
}

sum(cube)(1, 10) // equivalent to sumCubes

// Syntactic sugar:
def sum(f: Int => Int)(a: Int, b: Int): Int =
    if (a > b) 0 else f(a) + sum(f)(a+1, b)
{% endhighlight %}

*Function application associates to the left* so `sum(cube)(1, 10)` is equivalent to `(sum(cube))(1, 10)`.

The type of `sum` is `(Int => Int) => (Int, Int) => Int`. This should be read and understood as `(Int => Int) => ((Int, Int) => Int)` as *functional types associate to the right*.

## Classes: functions and data
In Scala, we use *classes* to define and create data structures:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def numer = x
    def denom = y
}

val x = new Rational(1, 2)
{% endhighlight %}

This introduces two entities:

- A new *type* named `Rational`
- A *constructor* `Rational` to create elements of this type

### Methods
One can go further and also package functions operating on a data abstraction into the data abstraction itself. Such functions are called *methods*.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def numer = x 
    def denom = y

    def add(that: Rational) = 
        new Rational(
            numer * that.denom + that.numer * denom,
            denom * that.denom)

    override def toString = numer + "/" + denom
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Identifier

The identifier is alphanumeric (starting with a letter, followed by letters or numbers) xor symbolic (starting with a symbol, followed by other symbols). We can mix them by using an alphanumeric name, an underscore `_` and then a symbol.

Small practical trick: to define a `neg` function that returns the negation of a `Rational`, we can write:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    ...

    def unary_- : Rational = new Rational(-numer, denom) // space between - and : because : shouldn't be a part of the identifier.
}
{% endhighlight %}

The *precedence* of an operator is determined by its first character, in the following priority (from lowest to highest):

- All letters
- `|`
- `^`
- `&`
- `< >`
- `= !`
- `:`
- `+ -`
- `* / %`
- All other symbolic characters

#### Infix notation
Any method with a parameter can be used like an infix operator:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
r add s                            r.add(s)
r less s     /* in place of */     r.less(s)
r max s                            r.max(s)
{% endhighlight %}

### Constructors
Scala naturally executes the code in the class body as an implicit constructor, but there is a way to explicitly define more constructors if necessary:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    def this(x: Int) = this(x, 1)

    def numer = x
    def denom = y
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Data abstraction
We can improve `Rational` by making it an irreducible fraction using the GCD:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    private def gcd(a: Int, b: Int): Int = if (b == 0) a else gcd(b, a % b)
    val numer = x / gcd(x, y) // Computed only once with a val
    val denom = y / gcd(x, y)

    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

There are obviously multiple ways of achieving this; the above code just shows one. The ability to choose different implementations of the data without affecting clients is called *data abstraction*.

### Assert and require
When calling the constructor, using a denominator of 0 will eventually lead to errors. There are two ways of imposing restrictions on the given constructor arguments:

- `require`, which throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if it fails
- `assert`, which throws an `AssertionError` if it fails

This reflects a difference in intent:

- `require` is used to enforce a precondition on the caller of a function
- `assert` is used to check the code of the function itself

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Rational(x: Int, y: Int) {
    require(y != 0, "denominator must be non-zero")
    
    val root = sqrt(this)
    assert(root >= 0)
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Class Hierarchies

### Abstract classes
Just like in [Java](/notes-prog/), we can have absctract classes and their implementation:
 
{% highlight scala linenos %}
abstract class IntSet {
    def incl(x: Int): IntSet
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean
}

class Empty extends IntSet { // Empty binary tree
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean = false
    def incl(x: Int): IntSet = new NonEmpty(x, new Empty, new Empty)
}

class NonEmpty(elem: Int, left: IntSet, right: Intset) extends IntSet { // left and right subtree
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean =
        if (x < elem) left contains x
        else if (x > elem) right contains x
        else true

    def incl(x: Int): IntSet = 
        if (x < elem) new NonEmpty(elem, left incl x, right)
        if (x > elem) new NonEmpty(elem, left, right incl x)
        else this // already in the tree, nothing to add
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Terminology
- `Empty` and `NonEmpty` both *extend* the class `IntSet`
- The definitions of `incl` and `contains` *implement* the abstract functions of `IntSet`
- This implies that the types `Empty` and `NonEmpty` *conform* to the type `IntSet`, and can be used wherever an `IntSet` is required
- `IntSet` is the superclass of `Empty` and `NonEmpty`
- `Empty` and `NonEmpty` are *subclasses* of `IntSet`
- In Scala, any user-defined class extends another class. By default, if no superclass is given, the superclass is `Object`
- The direct or indirect superclasses are called *base classes*

#### Override
It is possible to *redefine* an existing, non-abstract definition in a subclass by using `override`.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
abstract class Base {
    def foo = 1
    def bar: Int
}

class Sub extends Base {
    override def foo = 2 // You need to use override
    def bar = 3
}
{% endhighlight %}

Overriding something that isn't overrideable yields an error. 

### Traits
In Scala, a class can only have one superclass. But sometimes we want several supertypes. To do this we can use *traits*. It's declared just like an abstract class, but using the keyword `trait`:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
trait Planar {
    def height: Int // Abstract method as it lacks an implementation
    def width: Int
    def surface = height * width // Concrete method defining a default implementation
}
{% endhighlight %}

Classes, objects and traits can inherit from at most one class but as arbitrarily many traits.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class Square extends Shape with Planar with Movable ...
{% endhighlight %}

Traits **cannot** have value parameters, only classes can.

### Singleton objects
In the `IntSet` example, one could argue that there really only is a single empty `IntSet`, and that it's overkill to have the user create many instances of `Empty`. Instead we can define a *singleton object*:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
object Empty extends IntSet {
    def contains(x: Int): Boolean = false
    def incl(x: Int): IntSet = new NonEmpty(x, Empty, Empty)
}
{% endhighlight %}

Singleton objects are values, so `Empty` evaluates to itself.

### Packages and imports
Classes and objects are organized in packages, just like in Java. 

{% highlight scala linenos %}
package funprog.example

object Rational {
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

One can now call the object using its full qualified name, or with an import:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
object test {
    new funprog.example.Rational(1, 2)
}

// or
import funprog.example.Rational // Import Rational
import funprog.example.{Rational, Hello} // Import both Rational and Hello
import funprog.example._ // Or import everything in funprog.example

object test2 {
    new Rational(1, 2)
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Polymorphism
Just [like in Java](/notes-prog#gnricithttpcs108epflcharchive15filesppo1502genericitepdf), we may wish to have polymorphic types. 

{% highlight scala linenos %}
trait List[T] {
    def isEmpty: Boolean
    def head: T
    def tail: List[T]
}

class Cons[T](val head: T, val tail: List[T]) extends List[T] {
    def isEmpty = false

    // val head: T is a legal implementation of head
    // and so is val tail: List[T]
    // (they're in the argument list of Cons[T])
}

class Nil[T] extends List[T] {
    def isEmpty = true
    def head = throw new NoSuchElementException("Nil.head")
    def tail = throw new NoSuchElementException("Nil.tail") // returns type Nothing
}
{% endhighlight %}

Type parameters can be used in classes, but also in functions.

#### Type inference
The Scala compiler can usually deduce the correct type parameters.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def singleton[T](elem: T) = new Cons[T](elem, new Nil[T])

singleton[Int](1) // Explicit type definition
singleton(1) // Type inference
{% endhighlight %}

#### Type bounds
We can set the types of parameters as either subtypes or supertypes of something. For instance, a method that takes an `IntSet` and returns it if all elements are positive, or throws an error if not, could be implemented as such:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
// Can either return an Empty or a NonEmpty, depending on what it's given:
def assertAllPos[S <: IntSet](r: S): S = ...
{% endhighlight %}

Here, `<: IntSet` is an **upper bound** of the type parameter `S`. Generally:

- `S <: T` means `S` is a *subtype* of `T`
- `S >: T` means `S` is a *supertype* of `T`

It's also possible to mix a lower bound with an upper bound:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
[S >: NonEmpty <: IntSet]
{% endhighlight %}

This would restrict `S` to any type on the interval between `NonEmpty` and `IntSet`.

##### Covariance
Given `NonEmpty <: IntSet`, is `List[NonEmpty] <: List[IntSet]`? Yes!

Types for which this relationship holds are called **covariant** because their subtyping relationship varies with the type parameter. This makes sense in situations fitting the Liskov Substitution Principle (loosely paraphrased):

> If `A <: B`, then everything one can do with a value of type `B` one should also be able to do with a value of type `A`.

In Scala, for instance, `Array`s are not covariant.

There are in fact 3 types of variance:

- `C[A] <: C[B]` means `C` is **covariant**
- `C[A] >: C[B]` means `C` is **contravariant**
- Neither `C[A]` nor `C[B]` is a subtype of the other means `C` is **nonvariant**

Scala lets you declare the variance of a type by annotating the type parameter:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
class C[+A] { ... } // C is covariant
class C[-A] { ... } // C is contravariant
class C[A] { ... } // C is invariant
{% endhighlight %}

The Scala compiler checks that there are no problematic combinations when compiling a class with variance annotations. Roughly:

- *Covariant* type parameters can only appear in method results
- *Contravariant* type parameters can only appear in method parameters
- *Invariant* type parameters can appear anywhere

### Object oriented decomposition
Instead of writing external methods that apply to different types of subclasses, we can write the functionality inside the respective classes.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
trait Expr {
    def eval: Int
}
class Number(n: Int) extends Expr {
    def eval: Int = n
}
class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr {
    def eval: Int = e1.eval + e2.eval
}
{% endhighlight %}

But this is problematic if we need to add lots of methods but not add many classes, as we'll need to define new methods in all the subclasses. Another limitation of OO decomposition is that some non-local operations cannot be encapsulated in the method of a single object.

In these cases, [pattern matching](#pattern-matching) may be a better solution.

### Pattern matching
Pattern matching is a generalization of `switch` from C or Java, to class hierarchies. It's expressed in Scala using the keyword `match`:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def eval(e: Expr): Int = e match {
    case Number(n) => n
    case Sum(e1, e2) => eval(e1) + eval(e2)
}
{% endhighlight %}

If none of the cases match, a match error exception is thrown.

Patterns are constructed from:

- Constructors, e.g. `Number`, `Sum`
- Variables, e.g. `n`, `e1`, `e2`
- Wildcard patterns `_` (if we don't care about the argument, we can use `Number(_)`)
- Constants, e.g. `1`, `true` (by convention, start `const` with a capital letter).

These patterns can be stacked, so we may try to match a `Sum(Number(1), Var(x))` for instance. The same variable name can only appear once in a pattern, so `Sum(x, x)` is not a legal pattern.

It's possible to define the evaluation function as a method of the base trait: 

{% highlight scala linenos %}
trait Expr {
    def eval: Int = this match {
        case Number(n) => n
        case Sum(e1, e2) => e1.eval + e2.eval
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Pattern matching is especially useful when what we do is mainly to add methods (not really changing the class hierarchy). Otherwise, if we mainly create sub-classes, then [object-oriented decomposition](#object-oriented-decomposition) works best. 

### Case classes
A **case class** definition is similar to a normal class definition, except that it is preceded by the modifier `case`. For example:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
trait Epxr
case class Number(n: Int) extends Expr
case class Sum(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) extends Expr
{% endhighlight %}

Doing this implicitly defines companion object with `apply` methods.

{% highlight scala linenos %}
object Number {
    def apply(n: Int) = new Number(n)
}
object Sum {
    def apply(e1: Expr, e2: Expr) = new Sum(e1, e2)
}
{% endhighlight %}

This way we can just do `Number(1)` instead of `new Number(1)`.

## Lists
There are two important differences between lists and arrays:

- Lists are immutable &mdash; the elements of a list cannot be changed.
- Lists are recursive (linked lists), while arrays are flat.

Like arrays, lists are *homogeneous*: the elements of a list must all have the same type.

### List constructors
A bit of syntactic sugar: you can construct new lists using the construction operation `::` (pronounced *cons*).

{% highlight scala linenos %}
fruit = "apples" :: "oranges" :: "pears" :: Nil
List("apples", "oranges", "pears") // Equivalent
Nil.::("pears").::("oranges").::("apples") // Also equivalent
{% endhighlight %}

As a convention, operators ending in `:` associate to the right, and are calls on the right-hand operand.

### List patterns
It is also possible to decompose lists with pattern matching. Examples:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
Nil // Nil constant
p :: ps // A pattern that matches a list with a head matching p and a tail matching ps
List(p1, ..., pn) // Same as p1 :: ... :: pn :: Nil
1 :: 2 :: xs // Lists that start with 1 then 2
x :: Nil // Lists of length 1
List(x) // Same as x :: Nil
List() // Empty list, same as Nil
List(2 :: xs) // A list that contains as only element another list that starts with 2

x :: y :: List(xs, ys) :: zs // Lists of length >= 3 with a list of 2 elements in 3rd pos
{% endhighlight %}

We can do a really short insertion sort this way (but one that runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>))

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def isort(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
    case List() => List()
    case y :: ys => insert(y, isort(ys)) // y is head, ys is tail
}

def insert(x: Int, xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = xs match {
    case List() => List(x)
    case y :: ys => if (x <= y) x :: xs else y :: insert(x, ys) 
}
{% endhighlight %}

### List methods

#### Sublists and element access
- `xs.length`: The number of elements of `xs`
- `xs.last`: The list's last elemeent, exception if `xs` is empty
- `xs.init`: A list consisting of all elements of `xs` except the last one, except if `xs` is empty.
- `xs take n`: A list consisting of the first `n` elements of `xs` or `xs` itself if it's shorter than `n`
- `xs drop n`: The rest of the collection after taking `n` elements.
- `xs(n)`: The element of `xs` at index `n`

#### Creating new lists
- `xs ++ ys` or `xs ::: ys`: Concatenation of `xs` and `ys`
- `xs.reverse`: The list containing the elements of `xs` in reversed order
- `xs updated (n, x)`: The list containing the same elements as `xs`, except at index `n` where it contains `x`.

#### Finding elements
- `xs indexOf x`: The index of the first elemen in `xs` matching `x`, or `-1` if `x` does not appear in `xs`
- `xs contains x`: same as `xs indexOf x >= 0`

<!--
### Pairs and tuples
Not too interesting
-->

### Higher-order list functions
These are functions that work on lists and take another function as argument. The above examples often have similar structures, and we can identify patterns:

- transforming each element in a list in a certain way
- retrieving a list of all elements satisfying a criterion
- combining the elements of a list using an operator

Since Scala is a functional language, we can write generic function that implement these patterns using [higher-order functions](#higher-order-functions).

#### Map
The actual implementation of `map` is a bit more complicated for performance reasons, but follows something allong the lines of:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
abstract class List[T] {
    ...
    def map[U](f: T => U): List[U] = this match {
        case Nil => this
        case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs.map(f)
    }
}

// Multiplies all elements of the list by a factor
def scaleList(xs: List[Double], factor: Double): List[Double] =
    xs map (x => x * factor)

// Squares all elements of the list
def squareList(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = 
    xs map (x => x * x)
{% endhighlight %}

#### Filter
{% highlight scala linenos %}
abstract class List[T] {
    ...
    def filter(p: T => Boolean): List[T] = this match {
        case Nil => this
        case x :: xs => 
            if (p(x)) x :: xs.filter(p)
            else xs.filter(p)
    }
}

def positiveElems(xs: List[Int]): List[Int] = xs filter (x => x > 0)
{% endhighlight %}

There are a few other methods that extract sublists based on a predicate:

- `xs filterNot p`: Same as `xs filter (x >= !p(x))`
- `xs partition p`: Same as `(xs filter p, xs filterNot p)`
- `xs takeWhile p`: The longest prefix of list `xs` consisting of elements that all satisfy the predicate `p`
- `xs dropWihle p`: The remainder of the list `xs` after any leading elements satisfying `p` have been removed
- `xs span p`: Same as `(xs takeWhile p, xs dropWhile p)`

#### Reduce
A reduction of a list consist of a combination of the elements using a given operator (i.e. summing or multiplying all the elements).

For certain operations, the order matters, and there are therefore different  orders in which the reduction can be made.

One such function is `foldLeft`. It goes from left to right and  takes an *accumulator* `z` as an additional parameter, which is returned when `foldLeft` is called on an empty list. For instance

{% highlight scala linenos %}
// The general notation is:
// (List(x1, ..., xn) foldLeft z)(op)
// Which returns:
// ((z op x1) op ...) op xn

def sum(xs: List[Int]) = (xs foldLeft 0)(_ + _)
def product(xs: List[Int]) = (xs foldLeft 1)(_ * _)
{% endhighlight %}

*Note:* The `(_ + _)` notation is equivalent to `((x, y) => x + y)`.

`foldLeft` and `reduceLeft` (same as `foldLeft` but without the `z` argument) could be implemented as follows:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
abstract class List[T] {
    ...
    def reduceLeft(op: (T, T) => T): T = this match {
        case Nil     => throw new Error("Nil.reduceLeft")
        case x :: xs => (xs foldLeft x)(op)
    }

    def foldLeft[U](z: U)(op: (U, T) => U): U = this match {
        case Nil     => z
        case x :: xs => (xs foldLeft op(z, x))(op)
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`foldRight` and `reduceRight` follow similar implementations but put the parentheses to the right.


## Implicit parameters
If we wanted to generalize an implementation of merge sort to work on more types than just `Int`s, we could rewrite it as such:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def msort[T](xs: List[T])(lt: (T, T) => Boolean): List[T] = {
    val n = xs.length / 2
    if (n == 0) xs
    else {
        def merge(xs: List[T], ys: List[T]): List[T] = (xs, ys) match {
            case (Nil, ys) => ys
            case (xs, Nil) => xs
            case (x :: xs1, y :: ys1) =>
                if (lt(x, y)) x :: merge(xs1, ys)
                else y :: merge(xs, ys1)
        }
        val (fst, snd) = xs splitAt n
        merge(msort(fst)(lt), msort(snd)(lt))
    }
}

val nums = List(2, -4, 5, 6, 1)
msort(nums)((x, y) => x < y)

// Generalisation:
val fruits = List("apple", "pineapple", "orange", "banana")
msort(fruits)((x, y) => x.compareTo(y) < 0) # lexicographical order
{% endhighlight %}

As a tiny note, it's usually best to put the function value as the last parameter of a function, because that makes it more likely that the compiler can infer the types of the arguments of the function. E.g. we have written `(x, y) => x < y)` instead of `(x: Int, y: Int) => x < y`.

How can we make this code nicer? We can use the `Ordering` type to represent the function, and make it an implicit parameter:

{% highlight scala linenos %}
def msort[T](xs: List[T])(implicit ord: Ordering[T]): List[T] = {
    val n = xs.length / 2
    if (n == 0) xs
    else {
        def merge(xs: List[T], ys: List[T]): List[T] = (xs, ys) match {
            case (Nil, ys) => ys
            case (xs, Nil) => xs
            case (x :: xs1, y :: ys1) =>
                if (ord.lt(x, y)) x :: merge(xs1, ys)
                else y :: merge(xs, ys1)
        }
        val (fst, snd) = xs splitAt n
        merge(msort(fst), msort(snd)) // ord is visible at this scope
    }
}

val nums = List(2, -4, 5, 6, 1)
msort(nums)

// Generalisation:
val fruits = List("apple", "pineapple", "orange", "banana")
msort(fruits)
{% endhighlight %}

Using the `Ordering[T]` type means using the predefined default ordering, which we don't even need to supply to `msort`, namely `Ordering.String` and `Ordering.Int`.

When you write an implicit parameter, and you don't write an actual argument that matches that parameter, the compiler will figure out the right implicit to pass, based on the demanded type.

### Rules for implicit parameters
Say that a function takes an implicit parameter of type `T`. The compiler will search for an implicit definition that:

- is marked `implicit`
- has a type compatible with `T`
- is visible at the scope of the function call (see line 13 above), or is defined in a companion object associated with `T`

If there's a single (most specific) definition, it will be taken as actual argument for the implicit parameter. Otherwise, it's an error.

For instance, at line 13, the compiler inserts the `ord` parameter of `msort`

## Proof techniques
Before we can prove anything, we'll just assert that pure functional languages have a property called *referential transparency*, since they don't have side effects. This means that we can use reduction steps as equalities to some part of a term.

### Structural induction
The principle of structural induction is analogous to natural induction.

To prove a property `P(xs)` for all lists `xs`:

- **Base case**: Show that `P(Nil)` holds
- **Induction step**: for a list `xs`and some element `x`, show that if `P(xs)` holds then `P(x :: xs)` also holds.

Instead of constructing numbers and adding 1, we construct lists from `Nil` and add one element.
