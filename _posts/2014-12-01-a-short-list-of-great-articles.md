title: A short list of great articles

I read *a lot* of articles on a daily basis. But some of them really stand out to me: they give me food for thought, great insight into very interesting subjects, or are just generally eloquently written.

I thought that I'd compile a list of some of the best articles that I've read here (I'm keeping the full list that includes average articles to myself, as I don't see the point in sharing a big list of pieces that are just "OK").
