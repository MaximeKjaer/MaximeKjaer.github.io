I woke up to some amusing news this morning: some code that I have written was featured on [Upvoted](https://soundcloud.com/upvoted), reddit's official podcast!

To make a long story short: Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency, has sponsored a NASCAR driver, which let to quite a few people, myself included, developing an interest in the sport, and becoming fans of car #98.

I made a [Chrome extension](https://github.com/MaximeKjaer/NASCAR-votes) for the [Dogecoin community](http://reddit.com/r/dogecoin) so that people would remember to vote for Josh Wise, the driver of the 98 car, in the Sprint Fan Vote every day. Now, this was no major task; it's like 50 lines of code, tops. That being said, it still made it into the show! 

Am I more excited than I ought to be about this? Sure thing. But I'm super interested in the whole field of startups, and Alexis Ohanian is someone that I'm looking up to, so I'm almost feeling all giddy :)
