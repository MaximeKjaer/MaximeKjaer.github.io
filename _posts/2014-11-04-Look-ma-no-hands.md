Baby steps.

We're learning Java at the university. I usually feel like I have to test my code every few lines as I'm writing it, but today I was able to write 200 lines of code, compile it and have it just *work*. That is definitely a first for me (in Java, at least).

It's not technically hard, really. What is hard is changing my programming habits. But I'm glad to see that I'm able to, even on small details like this.
