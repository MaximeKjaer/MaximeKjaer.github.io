We'll always use subscript $n$ for data point, and $d$ for feature. $N$ is the data size and $D$ is the dimensionality.

## Linear regression
A linear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between inputs and the output. We will study three types of methods:

1. Grid search
2. Iterative optimization algorithms
3. Least squares

### Simple linear regression

For a single input dimension ($D=1$), we can use a simple linear regression, which is given by:

$$
\newcommand{\abs}[1]{\left\lvert#1\right\rvert}
\newcommand{\set}[1]{\left\{#1\right\}}
\newcommand{\norm}[1]{\left\lVert#1\right\rVert}
\newcommand{\frobnorm}[1]{\left\lVert#1\right\rVert_{\text{Frob}}}
\newcommand{\expect}[1]{\mathbb{E}\left[#1\right]}
\newcommand{\expectsub}[2]{\mathbb{E}_{#1}\left[#2\right]}
\newcommand{\cost}[1]{\mathcal{L}\left(#1\right)}
\newcommand{\Strain}{S_{\text{train}}}
\newcommand{\Stest}{S_{\text{test}}}
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{\arg\!\max}
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmin}{\arg\!\min}

y_n \approx f(x_n) := w_0 + w_1 x_{n1}
$$

$w = (w_0, w_1)$ are the parameters of the model.

### Multiple linear regression

If our data has multiple input dimensions, we obtain multivariate linear regression:

$$
y_n \approx 
    f(\pmb{x}_n) := w_0 + w_1 x_{n1} + \dots + w_D x_{wD} 
    = w_0 + \pmb{x}_n^t \begin{bmatrix}
        w_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        w_D \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    = \tilde{\pmb{x}}_n ^T \tilde{\pmb{w}}
$$

> 👉🏼 If we wanted to be a little more strict, we should write $f_{\pmb{w}}(\pmb{x}_n)$, as the model of course also depends on the weights.

The tilde notation means that we have included the offset term $w_0$, also known as the **bias**:

$$
\tilde{\pmb{x}}_n=\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ x_{n1} \\ \vdots \\ x_{nD} \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{D+1}, 
\quad
\tilde{\pmb{w}} = \begin{bmatrix}w_0 \\ w_1 \\ \vdots \\ w_D\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R^{D+1}}
$$

### The $D > N$ problem

If the number of parameters exceeds the number of data examples, we say that the task is *under-determined*. This can be solved by regularization, which we’ll get to more precisely later.

## Cost functions

$\pmb{x}_n$ is the data, which we can easily understand where comes from. But how does one find a good $\pmb{w}$ from the data? 

A **cost function** (also called loss function) is used to learn parameters that explain the data well. It quantifies how well our model does by giving errors a score, quantifying penalties for errors. Our goal is to find parameters that minimize the loss functions.

### Properties

Desirable properties of cost functions are:

- **Symmetry around 0**: that is, being off by a positive or negative amount is equivalent; what matters is the amplitude of the error, not the sign.
- **Robustness**: penalizes large errors at about the same rate as very large errors. This is a way to make sure that outliers don’t completely dominate our regression.

### Good cost functions

#### MSE

Probably the most commonly used cost function is Mean Square Error (MSE): 

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}}(\pmb{w}) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left(y_n - f(\pmb{x}_n)\right)^2
\label{def:mse}
$$

MSE is symmetrical around 0, but also tends to penalize outliers quite harshly (because it squares error): MSE is not robust. In practice, this is problematic, because outliers occur more often than we’d like to.

Note that we often use MSE with a factor $\frac{1}{2N}$ instead of $\frac{1}{N}$. This is because it makes for a cleaner derivative, but we'll get into that later. Just know that for all intents and purposes, it doesn't change really change anything about the behavior of the models we'll study.

#### MAE

When outliers are present, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) tends to fare better:

$$
\text{MAE}(\pmb{w}) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left| y_n - f(\pmb{x}_n)\right|
$$

Instead of squaring, we take the absolute value. This is more robust. Note that MAE isn’t differentiable at 0, but we’ll talk about that later.

There are other cost functions that are even more robust; these are available as additional reading, but is not exam material.

### Convexity

A function is **convex** iff a line joining two points never intersects with the function anywhere else. More strictly defined, a function $f(\pmb{u})$ with $\pmb{u}\in\chi$ is *convex* if, for any $\pmb{u}, \pmb{v} \in\chi$, and for any $0 \le\lambda\le 1$, we have:

$$
f(\lambda\pmb{u}+(1-\lambda)\pmb{v})\le\lambda f(\pmb{u}) +(1-\lambda)f(\pmb{v})
$$

A function is **strictly convex** if the above inequality is strict ($<$).

A stritly convex function has a unique global minimum $\pmb{w}^*$. For convex functions, every local minimum is a global minimum. This makes it a desirable property for loss functions, since it means that cost function optimization is guaranteed to find the global minimum.

Sums of convex functions are also convex. Therefore, MSE and MAE are convex.

## Optimization

### Learning / Estimation / Fitting

Given a cost function (or loss function) $\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})$, we wish to find $\pmb{w}^*$ which minimizes the cost:

$$
\min_{\pmb W}{\mathcal{L}(\pmb w)}, \quad\text{ subject to } \pmb w \in \mathbb R^D
$$

This is what we call **learning**: learning is simply an optimization problem, and as such, we’ll use an optimization algorithm to solve it – that is, find a good $\pmb w$.

### Grid search

This is one of the simplest optimization algorithms, although far from being the most efficient one. It can be described as “try all the values”, a kind of brute-force algorithm; you can think of it as nested for-loops over the individual $w_i$ weights.

For instance, if our weights are $\pmb{w} = \begin{bmatrix}w_1 \\ w_2\end{bmatrix}$, then we can try, say 4 values for $w_1$, 4 values for $w_2$, for a total of 16 values of $\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})$.

But obviously, complexity is exponential $\mathcal{O}(a^D)$ (where $a$ is the number of values to try), which is really bad, especially when we can have $D\approx$ millions of parameters. Additionally, grid search has no guarantees that it’ll find an optimum; it’ll just find the best value we tried.

If grid search sounds bad for optimization, that’s because it is. In practice, it is not used for optimization of parameters, but it *is* used to tune hyperparameters.

### Optimization landscapes

#### Local minimum

A vector $\pmb{w}^\*$ is a *local minimum* of a function $\mathcal{L}$ (we’re interested in the minimum of cost functions $\mathcal{L}$, which we denote with $\pmb{w}^*$, as opposed to any other value $\pmb{w}$, but this obviously holds for any function) if $\exists \epsilon > 0$ such that

$$
\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}^*) \le \mathcal{L(\pmb{w})}, \quad \forall\pmb w : \norm{\pmb{w} -\pmb{w}^*} < \epsilon
$$

In other words, the local minimum $\pmb{w}^*$ is better than all the neighbors in some non-zero radius.

#### Global minimum

The global minimum is defined by getting rid of the radius $\epsilon$ and comparing to all other values:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}^*) \le \mathcal{L(\pmb{w})}, \qquad \forall\pmb{w}\in\mathbb{R}^D
$$

#### Strict minimum

A minimum is said to be **strict** if the corresponding equality is strict for $\pmb{w} \ne \pmb{w}^*$, that is, there is only one minimum value.

### Smooth (differentiable) optimization

#### Gradient

A gradient at a given point is the slope of the tangent to the function at that point. It points to the direction of largest increase of the function. By following the gradient (in the opposite direction, because we’re searching for a minimum and not a maximum), we can find the minimum.

![Graphs of MSE and MAE](/images/ml/mse-mae.png)

Gradient is defined by:

$$
\nabla \mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) := \begin{bmatrix}
	\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})}{\partial w_1} \\
	\vdots \\
	\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})}{\partial w_D} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is a vector, i.e. $\nabla\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})\in\mathbb R^D$. Each dimension $i$ of the vector indicates how fast the cost $\mathcal{L}$ changes depending on the weight $w_i$.

#### Gradient descent

Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm. We start from a candidate $w^{(t)}$, and iterate.

$$
\pmb{w}^{(t+1)}:=\pmb{w}^{(t)} - \gamma \nabla\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}^{(t)}\right)
$$

As stated previously, we’re adding the negative gradient to find the minimum, hence the subtraction.

$\gamma$ is known as the **step-size**, which is a small value (maybe 0.1). You don’t want to be too aggressive with it, or you might risk overshooting in your descent. In practice, the step-size that makes the learning as fast as possible is often found by trial and error 🤷🏼‍♂️.

As an example, we will take an analytical look at a gradient descent, in order to understand its behavior and components. We will do gradient descent on a 1-parameter model, in which we minimize the MSE, which is defined as follows:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(w_0\right)=\frac{1}{2N}\sum_{n=1}^N{\left(y_n - w_0\right)^2}
$$

Note that we’re dividing by 2 on top of the regular MSE; it has no impact on finding the minimum, but when we will compute the gradient below, it will conveniently cancel out the $\frac{1}{2}$.

The gradient of $\cost{w_0}$ is:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla\cost{\pmb{w}}
	& = \frac{\partial}{\partial w_0}\cost{\pmb{w}} \\
	& = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{n=1}^N{-2(y_n - w_0)}  \\
	& = w_0 - \bar{y}
\end{align}
$$

And thus, our gradient descent is given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
w_0^{(t+1)}
	&:= w_0^{(t)} - \gamma\nabla\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb w\right) \\
	& = w_0^{(t)} - \gamma(w_0^{(t)} - \bar{y}) \\
	& = (1-\gamma)w_0^{(t)} + \gamma\bar{y}, 
	\qquad\text{where } \bar{y}:=\sum_{n}{\frac{y_n}{N}}
\end{align*}
$$

This sequence is guaranteed to converge for $\pmb{w}^* = \bar{y}$ (so the solution to this exact problem can be extracted analytically from gradient descent). This would set the cost function to 0, which is the minimum.

The choice of $\gamma$ has an influence on the algorithm’s outcome:

- If we pick $\gamma=1$, we would get to the optimum in one step
- If we pick $\gamma < 1$, we would get a little closer in every step, eventually converging to $\bar{y}$
- If we pick $\gamma > 1$, we are going to overshoot $\bar{y}$. Slightly bigger than 1 (say, 1.5) would still converge; $\gamma=2$ would loop infinitely between two points; $\gamma > 2$ diverges.

#### Gradient descent for linear MSE

Our linear regression is given by a line $\pmb{y}$ that is a regression for some data $\pmb{X}$:

$$
\pmb{y}=\begin{bmatrix}
	y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_N
\end{bmatrix}, 
\quad
\pmb{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1D} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \dots & x_{2D} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{N1} & x_{N2} & \dots & x_{ND} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Our model is:

$$
f_w(x)=\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}
$$

We define the error vector by:

$$
\pmb{e}=\pmb{y} - \pmb{Xw}, 
\quad \text{ or } \quad 
\pmb{e}_n = \pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w}
$$

The MSE can then be restated as follows:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right)
	:= \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{n=1}^N{\left( y_n - \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}\right)^2}
	=  \frac{1}{2N}\pmb{e}^T\pmb{e}
$$

And the gradient is, component-wise:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial\pmb{w}_d} \cost{\pmb{w}}
	= -\frac{1}{2N} \sum_{n=1}^N {2(y_n - \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}) \pmb{x}_{nd}}
	= -\frac{1}{N} (\pmb{X}_{:d})^T \pmb{e}
$$

We’re using column notation $\pmb{X}_{:d}$ to signify column $d$ of the matrix $X$.

And thus, all in all, our gradient is:

$$
\nabla\cost{\pmb{w}} = -\frac{1}{N}\pmb{X}^T\pmb{e}
$$

To compute this expression, we must compute:

- The error $\pmb e$, which takes $2N\cdot D - 1$ floating point operations (flops) for the matrix-vector multiplication, and $N$ for the subtraction, for a total of $2N\cdot D + N - 1$, which is $\mathcal{O}(N\cdot D)$
- The gradient $\nabla\mathcal{L}$, which costs $2N\cdot D + D - 1$, which is $\mathcal{O}(N\cdot D)$.

In total, this process is $\mathcal{O}(N\cdot D)$ at every step. This is not too bad, it’s equivalent to reading the data once.

#### Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

In ML, most cost functions are formulated as a sum of:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N{\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w})}
$$

In practice, this can be expensive to compute, so the solution is to sample a training point $n\in\set{1, N}$ uniformly at random, to be able to make the sum go away.

The stochastic gradient descent step is thus:

$$
\pmb{w}^{(t+1)}:=\pmb{w}^{(t)} - \gamma \nabla\mathcal{L}_n\left({\pmb{w}^{(t)}}\right)
$$

Why is it allowed to pick just one $n$ instead of the full thing? We won’t give a full proof, but the intuition is that:

$$
\expect{\nabla\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w})}
	= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N{\nabla\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w})}
	= \nabla\left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N{\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w})}\right)
	\equiv \nabla\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right)
$$

The gradient of a single n is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w}) = \frac{1}{2} \left(y_n -\pmb{x}_n^T w\right)^2 \\
\nabla\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w}) = (-x_n^T) (y_n-\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w})
$$

Note that $x_n^T \in\mathbb{R}^D$, and $(y_n-\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w})\in\mathbb{R}$. Computational complexity for this is $\mathcal{O}(D)$. 

#### Mini-batch SGD

But perhaps just picking a **single** value is too extreme; there is an intermediate version in which we choose a subset $B\subseteq \left[1, \dots, N\right]$ instead of a single point.

$$
g := \frac{1}{|B|}\sum_{n\in B}{\nabla\mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{w}^{(t)})} \\
w^{(t+1)} := w^{(t)} - \gamma\pmb{g}
$$

Note that if $\abs{B} = N$ then we’re performing a full gradient descent.

The computation of $\pmb{g}$ can be parallelized easily over $\abs{B}$ GPU threads, which is quite common in practice; $\abs{B}$ is thus often dictated by the number of available threads.

Computational complexity is $\mathcal{O}(\abs{B}\cdot D)$.

### Non-smooth (non-differentiable) optimization

We’ve defined convexity previously, but we can also use the following alternative characterization of convexity, for differentiable functions:

$$
\cost{\pmb{u}} \ge \cost{\pmb{w}} + \nabla \cost{\pmb{w}}^T (\pmb{u} - \pmb{w}) 
\quad \forall \pmb{u}, \pmb{w}
\iff \mathcal{L} \text{ convex}
$$

Meaning that the function must always lie above its linearization (which is the first-order Taylor expansion) to be convex.

![A convex function lies above its linearization](/images/ml/convex-above-linearization.png)

#### Subgradients

A vector $\pmb{g}\in\mathbb{R}^D$ such that:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb u\right) \ge \mathcal{L}\left(\pmb w\right) + \pmb{g}^T(\pmb u - \pmb w) \quad \forall \pmb{u}
$$

is called a **subgradient** to the function $\mathcal{L}$ at $\pmb{w}$. The subgradient forms a line that is always below the curve, somewhat like the gradient of a convex function.

![The subgradient lies below the function](/images/ml/subgradient-below-function.png)

This definition is valid even for an arbitrary $\mathcal{L}$ that may not be differentiable, and not even necessarily convex.

If the function $\mathcal{L}$ is differentiable at $\pmb w$, then the *only subgradient* at $\pmb{w}$ is $\pmb{g} = \nabla\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right)$.

#### Subgradient descent

This is exactly like gradient descent, except for the fact that we use the *subgradient* $\pmb{g}$ at the current iterate $\pmb{w}^{(t)}$ instead of the *gradient*:

$$
w^{(t+1)} := w^{(t)} - \gamma\pmb{g}
$$

For instance, MAE is not differentiable at 0, so we must use the subgradient.

$$
\text{Let }h: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \quad h(e) := |e| \\
\text{At } e, \text{the subgradient }
g \in \partial h = \begin{cases}
-1 & \text{if } e < 0 \\
[-1, 1] & \text{if } e = 0 \\
1 & \text{if } e > 0 \\
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $\partial h$ is somewhat confusing notation for the set of all possible subgradients at our position.

For linear regressions, the (sub)gradient is easy to compute using the *chain rule*.

Let $h$ be non-differentiable, $q$ differentiable, and $\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right) = h(q(w))$. The chain rule tells us that, at $\pmb w$, our subgradient is:

$$
g \in \partial h(q(\pmb{w})) \cdot \nabla q(\pmb{w})
$$

#### Stochastic subgradient descent

This is still commonly abbreviated SGD.

It’s exactly the same, except that $\pmb g$ is a subgradient to the randomly selected $\mathcal{L}_n$ at the current iterate $\pmb{w}^{(t)}$.

### Constrained optimization

Sometimes, optimization problems come posed with an additional constraint.

#### Convex sets

We’ve seen convexity for functions, but we can also define it for sets. A set $\mathcal{C}$ is convex iff the line segment between any two points of $\mathcal{C}$ lies in $\mathcal{C}$. That is, $\forall \pmb{u}, \pmb{v} \in \mathcal{C}, \quad \forall 0 \le \theta \le 1$, we have:

$$
\theta \pmb{u} + (1 - \theta)\pmb{v} \in \mathcal{C}
$$

This means that the line between any two points in the set $\mathcal{C}$ must also be fully contained within the set.

![Examples of convex and non-convex sets](/images/ml/convex-sets.png)

A couple of properties of convex sets:

- Intersection of convex sets is also convex.
- Projections onto convex sets are **unique** (and often efficient to compute).


#### Projected gradient descent

When dealing with constrained problems, we have two options. The first one is to add a projection onto $\mathcal{C}$ in every step:

$$
P_\mathcal{C}(\pmb{w}') := \arg{\min_{\pmb{v}\in\mathcal{C}}}\norm{\pmb{v-w'}}
$$

The rule for gradient descent can thus be updated to become:

$$
w^{(t+1)} := P_\mathcal{C}\left(w^{(t)} - \gamma \nabla \mathcal{L}(w^{(t)}) \right)
$$

This means that at every step, we compute the new $w^{(t+1)}$ normally, but apply a projection on top of that. In other words, if the regular gradient descent sets our weights outside of the constrained space, we project them back.

<figure>
    <img alt="Steps of projected SGD" src="/images/ml/projected-sgd.png" />
    <figcaption>Here, $w'$ is the result of regular SGD, i.e. $w' = w^{(t)} - \gamma \nabla \mathcal{L}(w^{(t)})$</figcaption>
</figure>

This is the same for stochastic gradient descent, and we have the same convergence properties.

Note that the computational cost of the projection is very important here, since it is performed at every step.

#### Turning constrained problems into unconstrained problems

If projection as described above is approach A, this is approach B.

We use a **penalty function**, such as the “brick wall” indicator function below:

$$
I_\mathcal{C}(\pmb w) = \begin{cases}
0 & \pmb{w} \in \mathcal{C} \\
+\infty & \pmb{w} \notin \mathcal{C}
\end{cases}
$$

We could also perhaps use something with a less drastic error value than $+\infty$, if we don’t care about the constraint quite as extreme.

Note that this is similar to regularization, which we’ll talk about later. 

Now, instead of directly solving $min_{\pmb{w}\in\mathcal{C}}{\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})}$, we solve for:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}\in \mathbb{R}^D} {
    \mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) + I_\mathcal{C}(\pmb{w})
}
$$

### Implementation issues in gradient methods

#### Stopping criteria

When $\norm{\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w})}$ is zero (or close to zero), we are often close to the optimum.

#### Optimality

If the second order derivative is positive (or positive semi-definite for the general case $D\ge1$), then it is a (possibly local) minimum. If the function is also convex, then this is necessarily a global minimum. That is:

$$
\nabla \mathcal{L(\pmb{w})} = 0, \quad \mathcal{L} \text{ convex}
\implies
\text{optimum at }\pmb{w}
$$

#### Step size

If $\gamma$ is too big, we might diverge ([as seen previously](#gradient-descent)). But if it is too small, we might be very slow! Convergence is only guaranteed for $\gamma < \gamma_{min}$, which is a value that depends on the problem. 

## Least squares

### Normal equations

In some rare cases, we can take an analytical approach to computing the optimum of the cost function, rather than a computational one; for instance, for linear regression with MSE, as we've done previously. These types of equations are sometimes called **normal equations**. This is one of the most popular methods for data fitting, called **least squares**.

How do we get these normal equations?

First, we show that the problem is convex. If that is the case, then according to the [optimality conditions](#optimality) for convex functions, the point at which the derivative is zero is the optimum:

$$
\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}^*)=\pmb{0}
$$

This gives us a system of $D$ equations known as the normal equations.

### Single parameter linear regression
Let's try this for a single parameter linear regression, with MSE as the cost function. 

First, we will just accept that the cost function is convex in the $w_0$ parameter. 

As [proven previously](#gradient-descent), we know that for the single parameter model, the derivative is:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right)
    & = \frac{\partial}{\partial w_0}\mathcal{L} \\
    & = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{n=1}^N{-2(y_n - w_0)}  \\
    & = w_0 - \bar{y}
\end{align}
$$

This means that the derivative is 0 for $w_0 = \bar{y}$. This allows us to define our optimum parameter $\pmb{w}^\*$ as $\pmb{w}^* = \begin{bmatrix}\bar{y}\end{bmatrix}$.

### Multiple parameter linear regression

As we know by now, the cost function for linear regression with MSE is:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(\pmb{w}\right)
	:= \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{n=1}^N{\left( y_n - \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}\right)^2}
	=  \frac{1}{2N}(\pmb{y-Xw})^T(\pmb{y-Xw})
$$


Where the matrices are defined as:

$$
\pmb{y}=\begin{bmatrix}
	y_1 \\ y_2 \\ \vdots \\ y_N
\end{bmatrix}, 
\quad
\pmb{X}=\begin{bmatrix}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \dots & x_{1D} \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \dots & x_{2D} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{N1} & x_{N2} & \dots & x_{ND} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$


We denote the $i^\text{th}$ row of $X$ by $x_i^T$. Each $x_i^T$ represents a different data point.

We claim that this cost function is *convex* in $\pmb{w}$. We can prove that in any of the following ways:

***

#### Simplest way
The cost function is the sum of many convex functions, and is thus also convex.

#### Directly verify the definition

$$
\forall \lambda\in [0,1], 
\quad \forall \pmb{w}, \pmb{w}',
\qquad
\mathcal{L}\left(\lambda\pmb{w} + \left(1-\lambda\right)\pmb{w}'\right) 
- \left(\lambda\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) + \left( 1-\lambda \right) \mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}')\right) \le 0
$$
  
The left-hand side of the inequality reduces to:
  
$$
-\frac{1}{2N}\lambda(1-\lambda)\norm{\pmb{X}(\pmb{w}-\pmb{w}')}_2^2
$$
   
which is indeed non-positive.

#### Compute the Hessian

The Hessian is the matrix of second derivatives, defined as follows:

$$
H_{ij} = \left( \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial w_i \partial w_j} \right)_{ij}
$$

If the Hessian is positive semidefinite (i.e. all its eigenvalues are non-negative), then the function is convex.
  
For our case, the Hessian is given by:
  
$$
\frac{1}{N}\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X}
$$
  
This is indeed positive semi-definite, as its eigenvalues are the squares of the eigenvalues of $\pmb{X}$, and must therefore be positive.

***

Knowing that the function is convex, we can find the minimum. If we take the gradient of this expression, we get:

$$
\nabla\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) = -\frac{1}{N}\pmb{X}^T(\pmb{y-Xw})
$$

We can set this to 0 to get the normal equations for linear regression, which are:

$$
\pmb{X}^T(\pmb{y-Xw}) =: \pmb{X}^T\pmb{e} = \pmb{0}
$$

This proves that the normal equations for linear regression are given by $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{e} = \pmb{0}$.

### Geometric interpretation

The above definition of normal equations are given by $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{e} = \pmb{0}$. How can visualize that?

The error is given by:

$$
\pmb{e} := \pmb{y} - \pmb{Xw}
$$

By definition, this error vector is orthogonal to all columns of $\pmb{X}$. Indeed, it tells us how far above or below the span our prediction $\pmb{y}$ is. 

The **span** of $\pmb{X}$ is the space spanned by the columns of $\pmb{X}$. Every element of the span can be written as $\pmb{u} = \pmb{Xw}$ for some choice of $\pmb{w}$. 

For the normal equations, we must pick an optimal $\pmb{w}^\*$ for which the gradient is 0. Picking an $\pmb{w}^\*$ is equivalent to picking an optimal $\pmb{u}^* = \pmb{Xw}^\*$ from the span of $\pmb{X}$.

But which element of $\text{span}(\pmb{X})$ shall we take, which one is the optimal one? The normal equations tell us that the optimum choice for $\pmb{u}$, called $$\pmb{u}^*$$ is the element such that $$\pmb{y} - \pmb{u}^*$$ is orthogonal to $\text{span}(X)$.

In other words, we should pick $\pmb{u}^*$ to be the projection of $\pmb{y}$ onto $\text{span}(\pmb{X})$.

### Least squares
All we've done so far is to solve the same old problem of a matrix equation:

$$
Ax = b
$$

But we've always done so with a bit of a twist; there may not be an exact value of $x$ satisfying exact equality, but we could find one that gets us as close as possible:

$$
Ax \approx b
$$

This is also what least squares does. It attempts to minimize the MSE to get as $Ax$ close as possible to $b$.

In this course, we often denote the data matrix $A$ as $\pmb{X}$, the weights $x$ as $\pmb{w}$, and $b$ as $y$; in other words, we're trying to solve:

$$
\pmb{X}\pmb{w} \approx \pmb{y}
$$

In least squares, we multiply this whole equation by $\pmb{X}^T$ on the left. We attempt to find $\pmb{w}^*$, the minimal weight that gets us as minimally wrong as possible. In other we're trying to solve:

$$
\left( \pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} \right) \pmb{w} \approx \pmb{X}^T\pmb{y}
$$

One way to solve this problem would simply be to invert the $A$ matrix, which in our case is $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X}$:

$$
\pmb{w}^* = (\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X})^{-1} \pmb{X}^T y
$$

As such, we can use this model to predict values for unseen data points:

$$
\hat{y}_m := \pmb{x}_m^T \pmb{w}^* = \pmb{x}_m^T (\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X})^{-1} \pmb{X}^T y
$$

### Invertibility and uniqueness
Note that the Gram matrix, defined as $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times D}$, is invertible **if and only if** $\pmb{X}$ has **full column rank**, or in other words, $\text{rank}(\pmb{X}) = D$.

$$
\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times D} \text{ invertible}
\iff
\text{rank}(\pmb{X}) = D
$$

Unfortunately, in practice, our data matrix $\pmb{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}$ is often **rank-deficient**.

- If $D>N$, we always have $\text{rank}(\pmb{X}) < D$ (since column and row rank are the same).
- If $D \le N$, but some of the columns $\pmb{x}_{:d}$ are collinear (or in practice, nearly collinear), then the matrix is **ill-conditioned**. This leads to numerical issues when solving the linear system.
  
  To know how bad things are, we can compute the condition number, which is the maximum eigenvalue of the Gram matrix, divided by the minimum See course contents of Numerical Methods.

If our data matrix is rank-deficient or ill-conditioned (which is practically always the case), we certainly shouldn't be inverting it directly! We'll introduce high numerical errors that falsify our output.

That doesn't mean we can't do least squares in practice. We can still use a linear solver. In Python, that means you should use [`np.linalg.solve`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.solve.html), which uses a LU decomposition internally and thus avoids the worst numerical errors. In any case, do not directly invert the matrix as we have done above! 


## Maximum likelihood
Maximum likelihood offers a second interpretation of least squares, but starting with a probabilistic approach.

### Gaussian distribution
A Gaussian random variable in $\mathbb{R}$ has mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. 

$$
\mathcal{N}(y \mid \mu, \sigma^2) = 
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} 
    \exp{\left[ -\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right]}
$$

For a Gaussian random *vector* (instead of a single random variable), with mean $\pmb{\mu}$ and covariance $\pmb{\Sigma}$ (which is positive semi-definite) is:

$$
\pmb{\mathcal{N}}(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{\mu}, \pmb{\Sigma}) = 
    \frac{1}
         {\sqrt{(2\pi)^D \text{ det}(\pmb{\Sigma})}} 

    \exp{\left[ -\frac{1}{2} (\pmb{y} - \pmb{\mu})^T \pmb{\Sigma}^{-1} (\pmb{y} - \pmb{u}) \right]}
$$

Remember that $\pmb{y} \in \mathbb{R}^N$. 

As another reminder, two variables $x$ and $y$ are said to be **independent** when $p(x, y) = p(x)p(y)$.

### A probabilistic model for least squares
We assume that our data is generated by a linear model $\pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w}$, with added Gaussian noise $\epsilon_n$:

$$
y_n = \pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w} + \epsilon_n
$$

This is often a realistic assumption in practice.

![Noise generated by a Gaussian source](/images/ml/gaussian-noise.png)

The noise is $\epsilon_n \overset{\text{i.i.d.}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(y_n \mid \mu = 0, \sigma^2)$ for each dimension $n$. In other words, it is centered at 0, has a certain variance, and the error in each dimension is independent of that in other dimensions. The model $\pmb{w}$ is, as always, unknown.

Given $N$ samples, the **likelihood** of the data vector $\pmb{y} = (y_1, \dots, y_n)$ given the model $\pmb{w}$ and the input $\pmb{X}$ (where each row is one input) is:

$$
p(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{X}, \pmb{w}) 
    = \prod_{n=1}^N {p(y_n \mid \pmb{x}_n, \pmb{w})}
    = \prod_{n=1}^N {\mathcal{N}(y_n \mid \pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w}, \sigma^2)}
$$

Intuitively, we'd like to maximize this likelihood over the choice of the best model $\pmb{w}$. The best model is the one that maximizes this likelihood.

### Defining cost with log-likelihood
The log-likelihood (LL) is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{LL} := \log{p(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{X}, \pmb{w})}
    = - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{n=1}^N{\left(y_n - \pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w}\right)^2} + \text{ cnst}
$$

Taking the log allows us to get away from the nasty product, and get a nice sum instead.

Notice that this definition looks pretty similar to MSE:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}}(\pmb{w}) := \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left(y_n - f(\pmb{x}_n)\right)^2
$$

Note that we would like to minimize MSE, but we want LL to be as high as possible (intuitively, we can look at the sign to understand that).

### Maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
Maximizing the log-likelihood (and thus the likelihood) will be equivalent to minimizing the MSE; this gives us another way to design cost functions. We can describe the whole process as:

$$
\argmin_{\pmb{w}}{\mathcal{L}_\text{MSE}(\pmb{w})} =
\argmax_{\pmb{w}}{\mathcal{L}_\text{LL}(\pmb{w})}
$$

The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) can be understood as finding the model under which the observed data is most likely to have been generated from (probabilistically). This interpretation has some advantages that we discuss below. 

#### Properties of MLE
MLE is a *sample* approximation to the *expected log-likelihood*. In other words, if we had an infinite amount of data, MLE would perfectly be equal to the expected value of the log-likelihood.

$$
\mathcal{L}_{LL}(\pmb{w}) 
    \approx \expectsub{p(y, \pmb{x})}{\log{p(y \mid \pmb{x}, \pmb{w})}}
$$

This means that MLE is **consistent**, i.e. it gives us the correct model assuming we have enough data. This means it converges in probability[^convergence-prob-distrib] to the true value:

$$
\pmb{w}_\text{MLE} \longrightarrow^p \pmb{w}_\text{true}
$$

MLE is asymptotically normal, meaning that the difference between the approximation and the true value of the weights converges in distribution[^convergence-prob-distrib] to a normal distribution centered at 0, and with variance $\frac{1}{N}$ times the Fisher information of the true value:

[^convergence-prob-distrib]: Convergence in probability means that the actual realizations of $X$ converges to that of $Y$ (i.e. $P(X=Y)\rightarrow 1$), while convergence in distribution means that the distribution function of $X$ converges to that of $Y$ (but without any guarantee that the actual realizations will be the same). Convergence in probability implies convergence in distribution, and is therefore a stronger assertion.

$$
(\pmb{w}_{\text{MLE}} - \pmb{w}_{\text{true}}) 
\longrightarrow^d
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \mathcal{N}(\pmb{w}_{\text{MLE}} \mid \pmb{0}, \pmb{F}^{-1}(\pmb{w}_{\text{true}}))
$$

Where the Fisher information[^fisher-information] is:

$$
\pmb{F}(\pmb{w}) 
= -\expectsub{p(\pmb{y})}{
    \frac{\partial^2\mathcal{L}}{\partial\pmb{w}\partial\pmb{w}^T}
}
$$

[^fisher-information]: Fisher information is a way of measuring the information that a random variable carries about an unknown parameter. See [the Wikipedia article for Fisher information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information).

This sounds amazing, but the catch is that this all is under the assumption that the noise $\epsilon$ indeed was generated under a Gaussian model.

## Overfitting and underfitting

### Underfitting with linear models
Linear models can very easily underfit; as soon as the data itself is given by anything more complex than a line, fitting a linear model will underfit: the model is too simple for the data, and we'll have huge errors.

But we can also easily overfit, where our model learns the specificities of the data too intimately. And this happens quite easily with linear combination of high-degree polynomials.

### Extended feature vectors
We can actually get high-degree linear combinations of polynomials, but still keep our linear model. Instead of making the model more complex, we simply "augment" the input to become degree $M$. If the input is one-dimensional, we can add a polynomial basis to the input:

$$
\pmb{\phi}(x_n) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & x_n & x_n^2 & x_n^3 & \dots & x_n^M
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that this is basically a [Vandermonde matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix).

We then fit a linear model to this extended feature vector $\pmb{\phi}(x_n)$:

$$
y_n \approx w_0 + w_1 x_n + w_2 x_n^2 + \dots + w_m x_n^M =: \pmb{\phi}(x_n)^T\pmb{w}
$$

Here, $\pmb{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{M+1}$. In other words, there are $M+1$ parameters in a degree $M$ extended feature vector. One should be careful with this degree; too high may overfit, too low may underfit.

If it is important to distinguish the original input $\pmb{x}$ from the augmented input $\pmb{\phi}(\pmb{x})$ then we will use the $\pmb{\phi}(\pmb{x})$ notation. But often, we can just consider this as a part of the pre-processing, and simply write $\pmb{x}$ as the input, which will save us a lot of notation.

### Reducing overfitting
To reduce overfitting, we can chose a less complex model (in the above, we can pick a lower degree $M$), but we could also just add more data:

![An overfitted model acts more reasonably when we add a bunch of data](/images/ml/reduce-overfit-add-data.png)

## Regularization
To prevent overfitting, we can introduce **regularization** to penalize complex models. This can be applied to any model.

The idea is to not only minimize cost, but also minimize a regularizer:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}} {\mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) + \Omega(\pmb{w})}
$$

The $\Omega$ function is the regularizer, measuring the complexity of the model. We'll see some good candidates for the regularizer below.

### $L_2$-Regularization: Ridge Regression
The most frequently used regularizer is the standard Euclidean norm ($L_2$-norm):

$$
\Omega(\pmb{w}) = \lambda \norm{\pmb{w}}^2_2
$$

Where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. The value of $\lambda$ will affect the fit; $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ can have overfitting, while $\lambda \rightarrow \infty$ can have underfitting.

The norm is given by:

$$
\norm{\pmb{w}}_2^2 = \sum_i{w_i^2}
$$

The main effect of this is that large model weights $w_i$ will be penalized, while small ones won't affect our minimization too much.

#### Ridge regression
Depending on the values we choose for $\mathcal{L}$ and $\Omega$, we get into some special cases. For instance, choosing MSE for $\mathcal{L}$ is called **ridge regression**, in which we optimize the following:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}} {\left(\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left[y_n - f(\pmb{x}_n)\right]^2 \quad + \quad \Omega(\pmb{w})\right)}
$$

Least squares is also a special case of ridge regression, where $\lambda = 0$

We can find an explicit solution for $\pmb{w}$ in ridge regression by differentiating the cost and regularizer, and setting them to zero:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) & = -\frac{1}{N} \pmb{X}^T (\pmb{y} - \pmb{Xw}) \\ \\
\nabla \Omega(\pmb{w}) & = 2\lambda \pmb{w} \\
\end{align}
$$

We can now set the full cost to zero, which gives us the result:

$$
\pmb{w}^*_\text{ridge} = (\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} + \lambda' \pmb{I})^{-1}\pmb{X}^T\pmb{y}
$$

Where $\frac{\lambda'}{2N} = \lambda$. Note that for $\lambda = 0$, we have the least squares solution. 

#### Ridge regression to fight ill-conditioning 
This formulation of $\pmb{w}^*$ is quite nice, because adding the identity matrix helps us get something that always is invertible; in cases where we have ill-conditioned matrices, it also means that we can invert with more stability.

We'll prove that the matrix indeed is invertible. The gist is that the eigenvalues of $(\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} + \lambda' \pmb{I})$ are all at least $\lambda'$. 

To prove it, we'll write the singular value decomposition (SVD) of $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X}$ as $\pmb{USU}^T$. We then have:

$$
\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} + \lambda'\pmb{I} = \pmb{USU}^T + \lambda'\pmb{UIU}^T = \pmb{U}(\pmb{S} + \lambda'\pmb{I})\pmb{U}^T
$$

The singular value is "lifted" by an amount $\lambda'$. There's an alternative proof in the class notes, but we won't go into that.

### $L_1$-Regularization: The Lasso
We can use a different norm as an alternative measure of complexity. The combination of $L_1$-norm and MSE is known as **The Lasso**:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}} {\frac{1}{2N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left[y_n - f(\pmb{x}_n)\right]^2 + \lambda \norm{w}_1}
$$

Where the $L_1$-norm is defined as

$$
\norm{w}_1 := \sum_i{\abs{w_i}}
$$

If we draw out a constant value of the $L_1$ norm, we get a sort of "ball". Below, we've graphed $\left\\{ \pmb{w} \mid \norm{\pmb{w}}_1 \le 5 \right\\}$.

![Graph of the lasso](/images/ml/lasso.png)

To keep things in the following, we'll just claim that $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X}$ is invertible. We'll also claim that the following set is an ellipsoid which scales around the origin as we change $\alpha$:

$$
\left\{
    \pmb{w} \mid \norm{\pmb{y} - \pmb{Xw}}^2 = \alpha
\right\}
$$

The slides have a formal proof for this, but we won't get into it.

Note that the above definition of the set corresponds to the set of points with equal loss (which we can assume is MSE, for instance):

$$
\left\{
    \pmb{w} \mid \mathcal{L}(\pmb{w}) = \alpha
\right\}
$$

Under these assumptions, we claim that for $L_1$ regularization, the optimum solution will likely be sparse (many zero components) compared to $L_2$ regularization.

To prove this, suppose we know the $L_1$ norm of the optimum solution. Visualizing that ball, we know that our optimum solution $\pmb{w}^\*$ will be somewhere on the surface of that ball. We also know that there are ellipsoids, all with the same mean and rotation, describing the equal error surfaces. The optimum solution is where the "smallest" of these ellipsoids just touches the
$L_1$ ball.

![Intersection of the L1 ball and the cost ellipses](/images/ml/ball-ellipse.png)

Due to the geometry of this ball this point is more likely to be on one of the "corner" points. In turn, sparsity is desirable, since it leads to a "simple" model.

## Model selection
As we've seen in ridge regression, we have a *regularization parameter* $\lambda > 0$ that can be tuned to reduce overfitting by reducing model complexity. We say that the parameter $\lambda$  is a **hyperparameter**.

We've also seen ways to enrich model complexity, like [polynomial feature expansion](#extended-feature-vectors), in which the degree $M$ is also a hyperparameter.

We'll now see how best to choose these hyperparameters; this is called the **model selection** problem.

### Probabilistic setup
We assume that there is an (unknown) underlying distribution $\mathcal{D}$ producing the dataset, with range $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}$. The dataset $\mathcal{S}$ we see is produced from samples from $\mathcal{D}$:

$$
S = \left\{(\pmb{x}_n, y_n) 
\overset{\text{i.i.d}}{\sim}
\mathcal{D}\right\}_{n=1}^N
$$

Based on this, the *learning algorithm* choses the "best" model, under the parameters of the algorithm.

We write $f_s = \mathcal{A}(S)$, where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the learning algorithm. It depends on the data subset we're given, and $f_s$ is the resulting prediction of our model.

To indicate that $f_s$ sometimes depend on hyperparameters, we'll write $f_{s, \lambda}$.

### Training Error vs. Generalization Error
Given a model $f$, how can we asses if $f$ is any good? We already have the loss function, but its result is highly dependent on the error in the data, not to how good the model is. Instead, we can compute the *expected error* over all samples chosen according to $\mathcal{D}$.

$$
L_\mathcal{D}(f) = \expectsub{\mathcal{D}}{\mathcal{l}(y, f(\pmb{x}))}
$$

Where $\mathcal{l}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is our loss function; e.g. for ridge regression, $\mathcal{l}(y, f(\pmb{x})) = \frac{1}{2}(y-f(\pmb{x}))^2$.

The quantity $L_\mathcal{D}(f)$ has many names, including **generalization error** (or true/expected error/risk/loss). This is the quantity that we are fundamentally interested in, but we cannot compute it since $\mathcal{D}$ is unknown.

What we do know is the data subset $\mathcal{S}$. It's therefore natural to compute the equivalent *empirical* quantity, which is the average loss:

$$
L_S(f) = \frac{1}{\abs{S}} \sum_{(\pmb{x}_n, y_n)\in S} {\mathcal{l}(y_n, f(\pmb{x}_n))}
$$

But again, we run into trouble. The function $f$ is itself a function of the data $S$, so what we really do is to compute the quantity:

$$
L_S(f_S) = \frac{1}{\abs{S}} \sum_{(\pmb{x}_n, y_n)\in S} {\mathcal{l}(y_n, f_S(\pmb{x}_n))}
$$

$f_S$ is the trained model. This is called the **training error**. Usually, the training error is smaller than the generalization error, because overfitting can happen (even with regularization, because the hyperparameter may still be too low).

### Splitting the data
To avoid validating the model on the same data subset we trained it on (which is conducive to overfitting), we can split the data into a **training set** and a **test set** (aka *validation set*), which we call $\Strain$ and $\Stest$.

We apply the learning algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ on the training set $\Strain$, and compute the function $f_{\Strain}$. We then compute the error on the test set:

$$
L_{\Stest}(f_{\Strain}) = \frac{1}{\abs{\Stest}} \sum_{(\pmb{x}_n, y_n)\in \Stest} {\mathcal{l}(y_n, f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_n))}
$$

If we have duplicates in our data, then this could be a bit dangerous. Still, in general, this really helps us with the problem of overfitting since $\Stest$ is a "fresh" sample, which means that we can hope that $L_{\Stest}(f_{\Strain})$ defined above is close to the quantity $L_\mathcal{D}(f_{\Strain})$. Indeed, *in expectation* both are the same:

$$
L_\mathcal{D}(f_{\Strain}) 
= \expectsub{\Stest\sim\mathcal{D}}{
    L_{\Stest}(f_{\Strain})
}
$$

This is a quite nice property, but there are a few limits. First, we paid a price by splitting the data and thus reducing the size of our training data, though this can be mediated using cross-validation, which we'll see later. 

### Generalization error vs test error
Assume that we have a model $f$ and that our loss function $\mathcal{l}(\cdot, \cdot)$ is bounded in $[a, b]$. We are given a test set $\Stest$ chosen i.i.d. from the underlying distribution $\mathcal{D}$. 

How far apart is the test error (empirical) from the true generalization error? As we've seen above, they are the same in expectation. But we need to worry about the variation, about how far off from the true error we typically are:

We claim that:

$$
\mathbb{P}\left[
    \abs{L_\mathcal{D}(f) - L_{\Stest}(f)}
    \ge
    \sqrt{\frac{(b-a)^2 \ln{(2/\delta)}}{2\abs{\Stest}}}
\right]
\le \delta
\label{eq:loss-bound}
\tag{loss-bound}
$$

Where $\delta > 0$ is a quality parameter. This gives us an upper bound on how far away our empirical loss is from the true loss.

This bound gives us some nice insights. Error decreases in the size of the test set as $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\abs{\Stest}})$, so the more data points we have, the more confident we can be in the empirical loss being close to the true loss.

We'll prove $\ref{eq:loss-bound}$. We assumed that each sample in the test set is chosen independently. Therefore, given a model $f$, the associated losses $\mathcal{l}(y_n, f(\pmb{x}_n))$ are also i.i.d. random variables, taking values in $[a, b]$ by assumption. We can call each such loss $\Theta_n$:

$$
\Theta_n = \mathcal{l}(y_n, f(\pmb{x}_n))
$$

This is just a naming alias; since the underlying value is that of the loss function, the expected value of $\Theta_n$ is simply that of the loss function, which is the true loss:

$$
\expect{\Theta_n} = \expect{\mathcal{l}(y_n, f(\pmb{x}_n))} = L_\mathcal{D}(f)
$$

The empirical loss on the other hand is equal to the average of $\abs{\Stest}$ such i.i.d. values. 

The formula of $\ref{eq:loss-bound}$ gives us the probability that empirical loss $L_{\Stest}(f)$ diverges from the true loss by more than a given constant, which is a classical problem addressed in the following lemma (which we'll just assert, not prove).

{% comment %} lemma Chernoff Bound {% endcomment %}
**Chernoff Bound**: Let $\Theta_1, \dots, \Theta_n$ be a sequence of i.i.d random variables with mean $\expect{\Theta}$ and range $[a, b]$. Then, for any $\epsilon > 0$:

$$
\mathbb{P}\left[
    \abs{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N {\Theta_n - \expect{\Theta}}}
    \ge
    \epsilon
\right]
\le
2\exp{\left(\frac{-2N\epsilon^2}{(b-a)^2}\right)}
\label{eq:Chernoff}
\tag{Chernoff}
$$
{% comment %} endlemma {% endcomment %}

Using $\ref{eq:Chernoff}$ we can show $\ref{eq:loss-bound}$. By setting $\delta = 2\exp{\left(\frac{-2N\epsilon^2}{(b-a)^2}\right)}$, we find that $\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{(b-a)^2 \ln{(2/\delta)}}{2\abs{\Stest}}}$ as claimed.

### Model selection
Our main goal was to look for a way to select the hyperparameters of our model. Given a finite set of values $\lambda_k$ for $k=1, \dots, K$ of a hyperparameter $\lambda$, we can run the learning algorithm $K$ times on the same training set $\Strain$, and compute the $K$ prediction functions $f_{\Strain, \lambda_k}$. For each such prediction function we compute the test error, and choose the $\lambda_k$ which minimizes the test error.

This is essentially a grid search on $\lambda$ using the test error function.

#### Model selection based on test error
How do we know that, for a fixed function $f$, $L_{\Stest}(f)$ is a good approximation to $f_\mathcal{D}$?

The answer to this follows the same idea as when we talked about [generalization vs test error](#generalization-error-vs-test-error), but we now assume that we have $K$ models $f_k$ for $k=1, \dots, K$. We assume again that the loss function is bounded in $[a, b]$, and that we're given a test set whose samples are chosen i.i.d. in $\mathcal{D}$.

How far is each of the $K$ (empirical) test errors $L_{\Stest}(f_k)$ from the true $L_\mathcal{D}(f_k)$? As before, we can bound the deviation for all $k$ candidates, by:

$$
\mathbb{P}\left[
    \max_k {\abs{L_\mathcal{D}(f_k) - L_{\Stest}(f_k)}}
    \ge
    \sqrt{\frac{(b-a)^2 \ln{(2K/\delta)}}{2\abs{\Stest}}}
\right]
\le \delta
$$

A bit of intuition of where this comes from: for a general $K$, if we check the deviations for $K$ independent samples and ask for the probability that for at least one such sample we get a deviation of at least $\epsilon$ (this is what the Chernoff bound answers). Then by the union bound this probability is at most $K$ times as large as in the case where we are only concerned with a single instance. Thus the upper bound in Chernoff becomes $2K\exp{\left(\frac{-2N\epsilon^2}{(b-a)^2}\right)}$, which gives us $\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{(b-a)^2 \ln{(2K/\delta)}}{2\abs{\Stest}}}$ as above.

As before, this tells us that error decreases in $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\abs{\Stest}})$. Now that we test $K$ hyperparameters, our error only goes up by a tiny amount of $\sqrt{\ln{(K)}}$. This follows from $\ref{eq:loss-bound}$, which we proved for the special case of $K = 1$.

### Cross-validation
Splitting the data once into two parts (one for training and one for testing) is not the most efficient way to use the data. Cross-validation is a better way.

K-fold cross-validation is a popular variant. We randomly partition the data into $K$ groups, and train $K$ times. Each time, we use one of the $K$ groups as our test set, and the remaining $K−1$ groups for training. 

To get a common result, we average out the $K$ results. This means we'll use  the average weights to get the average test error over the $K$ folds.

Cross-validation returns an unbiased estimate of the generalization error and its variance.

### Bias-Variance decomposition
When we perform model selection, there is an inherent [bias&ndash;variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff) trade-off.

    <figcaption>Graphical illustration of bias and variance. Taken from <a href="http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html">Scott Fortmann-Roe's website</a></figcaption>
</figure>

For now, we'll just look at "high-bias & low-variance" models, and "high-variance & low-bias" models.

- **High-bias & low-variance**: the model is too simple. It's underfit, has a large bias, and and the variance of $L_\mathcal{D}(f_S)$ is small.
- **High-variance & low-bias**: the model is too complex. It's overfit, has a small bias and large variance of $L_\mathcal{D}(f_S)$ (as a single addition of a data point is likely to change the prediction function $f_S$ considerably)

Consider a linear regression with one-dimensional input and [polynomial feature expansion](#extended-feature-vectors) of degree $d$. The former can be achieved by picking a too low value for $d$, while the latter by picking $d$ too high. The same principle applies for other parameters, such as ridge regression with hyperparameter $\lambda$.

#### Data generation model
Let's assume that our data is generated by some arbitrary, unknown function $f$, and a noise source with distribution $\mathcal{D}_\epsilon$ (i.i.d. from sample to sample, and independent from the data). We can think of $f$ representing the precise, hypothetical function that perfectly produced the data. We assume that the noise has mean zero (without loss of generality, as a non-zero mean could be encoded into $f$).

$$
y = f(\pmb{x}) + \epsilon
$$

We assume that $\pmb{x}$ is generated according to some fixed but unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}_{\pmb{x}}$. We'll be working with square loss as our loss function $\mathcal{l}(\cdot, \cdot)$. We will denote the joint distribution on pairs $(\pmb{x}, y)$ as $\mathcal{D}$.

#### Error Decomposition
As always, we have a training set $\Strain$, which consists of $N$ i.i.d. samples from $\mathcal{D}$. Given our learning algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, we compute the prediction function $f_{\Strain} = \mathcal{A}(\Strain)$. The square loss of a single prediction for a fixed element $\pmb{x}_0$ is given by the computation of:

$$
\bigl( y_0 - f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_0) \bigr)^2
= 
\bigl( f(\pmb{x}_0) + \epsilon - f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_0) \bigr)^2
$$

Our experiment was to create $\Strain$, learn $f_{\Strain}$, and then evaluate the performance by computing the square loss for a fixed element $\pmb{x}_0$. If we run this experiment many times, the expected value is written as:

$$
\expectsub{\Strain \sim \mathcal{D},\ \epsilon\sim\mathcal{D}_\epsilon}{
    \left( f(\pmb{x}_0) + \epsilon - f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_0) \right)^2
}
$$

We will now show that this expression can be rewritten as a sum of three non-negative terms, and that each of these:

$$
\newcommand{\otherconstantterm}{\mathbb{E}_{S'_\text{train}\sim\mathcal{D}}\left[f_{S'_\text{train}}(\pmb{x}_0)\right]}

\begin{align}
& \expectsub{\Strain \sim \mathcal{D},\ \epsilon\sim\mathcal{D}_\epsilon} {
    \left( f(\pmb{x}_0) + \epsilon - f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_0) \right)^2
} \\

\overset{(a)}{=}\  & 
    \expectsub{\epsilon\sim\mathcal{D}_\epsilon} {
        \epsilon^2
    }
    + \expectsub{\Strain \sim \mathcal{D}} {
        \bigl(f(\pmb{x}_0) - f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_0)\bigl)^2
    } \\

\overset{(b)}{=}\ & 
    \text{Var}_{\epsilon\sim\mathcal{D}_\epsilon}\left[\epsilon\right]
    + \expectsub{\Strain \sim \mathcal{D}}{
        \bigl(f(\pmb{x}_0) - f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}_0)\bigl)^2
    } \\

\overset{(c)}{=}\ &
    \underbrace{
        \text{Var}_{\epsilon\sim\mathcal{D}_\epsilon}\left[\epsilon\right]
    }_\text{noise variance} \\
& + \underbrace{
    \left( f(\pmb{x}_0) - \otherconstantterm \right)^2
}_\text{bias} \\
& + \expectsub{\Strain\sim\mathcal{D}} {
        \underbrace{
            \left( \otherconstantterm - f_{\Strain(\pmb{x}_0)} \right)^2
        }_\text{variance}
    } \\
\end{align}
$$

Note that here, $S\'\_\text{train}$ is a second training set, also sampled from $\mathcal{D}$, that is independent of the training set $\Strain$. It has the same expectation, but it is different and thus produces a different trained model $f_{S'}$.

Step $(a)$ uses $(u+v)^2 = u^2 + 2uv + v^2$ as well as linearity of expectation produce $\expect{(u+v)^2} = \expect{u^2} + 2\expect{uv} + \expect{v^2}$. Note that the $2uv$ part is zero as the noise $\epsilon$ is independent from $\Strain$.

Step $(b)$ uses the definition of variance as:

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \expect{(X - \expect{X})^2} = \expect{X^2} - \expect{X}^2
$$

Seeing that our noise $\epsilon$ has mean zero, we have $\expect{\epsilon}^2 = 0$ and therefore $\text{Var}(\epsilon) = \expect{\epsilon^2}$. 

In step $(c)$, we add and subtract the constant term $\otherconstantterm$ to the expression like so:

$$
\expectsub{S\sim \mathcal{D}}{\left(
    \underbrace{A - \otherconstantterm}_u + \underbrace{\otherconstantterm + B}_v
\right)^2}
$$

We can then expand the square. The $2uv$ part of the expansion is zero, as we show below:

$$
\begin{align}
& \expectsub{S \sim \mathcal{D}} {
    \left( 
        f(\pmb{x}_0) - \otherconstantterm 
    \right) \cdot \left(
        \otherconstantterm - f_S(\pmb{x}_0)
    \right)
} \\
& = \left(
    f(\pmb{x}_0) - \otherconstantterm 
\right) \cdot \expectsub{S\sim\mathcal{D}} {
    \otherconstantterm - f_S(\pmb{x}_0)
} \\
& = \left(
    f(\pmb{x}_0) - \otherconstantterm 
\right) \cdot \left(
    \otherconstantterm - \expectsub{S\sim\mathcal{D}}{S(\pmb{x}_0)}
\right) \\
& = 0 \\
\end{align} 
$$

#### Interpretation of the decomposition
Each of the three terms in non-negative, so each of them is a lower bound on the expected loss when we predict the value for the input $\pmb{x}_0$.

- When the data contains **noise**, then that imposes a strict lower bound on the error we can achieve.
- The **bias term** is a non-negative term that tells us how far we are from the true value, in expectation. It's the square loss between the actual value $f(\pmb{x}_0)$ and the expected prediction, where the expectation is over the training sets. As [we discussed above](#bias-variance-decomposition), with a simple model we will not find a good fit on average, which means the bias will be large, which adds to the error we observe.
- The **variance term** is the variance of the prediction function. For complex models, small variations in the data set can produce vastly different models, and our prediction will vary widely, which also adds to our total error.

## Classification
When we did regression, our data was of the form:

$$
\mathcal{S}_\text{train} = \left\{(x_n, y_n)\right\}_{n=1}^N,
\qquad x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d,\ y_n \in\mathbb{R}
$$

With **classification**, our prediction is no longer discrete. Now, $y_n\in\left\\{\mathcal{C}\_0, \dots, \mathcal{C}_{K-1} \right\\}$. If it can only take two values (i.e. $K=2$), then it is called **binary classification**. If it can take more than two values, it is **multi-class classification**.

There is no ordering among these classes, so we may sometimes denote these labels as $y\in\left\\{0, 1, 2, \dots, K-1\right\\}$.

If we have an underlying distribution $\mathcal{D}$, then we can write:

$$
\expect{\mathbb{I}\left\{ y-f(x) \ne 0 \right\}} = \mathbb{P}(y-f(x) \ne 0)
$$

Where $\mathbb{I}$ is an indicator function that returns 1 when the condition is correct, and 0 otherwise.

### Linear classifier
A classifier will divide the input space into a collection of regions belonging to each class; the boundaries are called **decision boundaries**.

A linear classifier splits the input with a line in 2D, a plane in 3D, or more generally, a hyperplane. But a linear classifier can also classify more complex shapes if we allow for [feature augmentation](#extended-feature-vectors). For instance (in 2D), if we augment the input to degree $M=2$ and a constant factor, our linear classifier can also detect ellipsoids. So without loss of generality, we'll simply study linear classifiers and allow feature augmentation, without loss of generality.

### Is classification a special case of regression?
From the initial definition of classification, we see that it is a special case of regression, where the output $y$ is restricted to a small discrete set instead of a continuous spectrum.

We could construct classification from regression by simply rounding to the nearest $\mathcal{C}\_i$ value. For instance, if we have $y\in\left\\{0, 1\right\\}$, we can use (regularized) least-squares to learn a prediction function $f_{\Strain}$ for this regression problem. We can then convert the regression to a classification by rounding: we decide on $\mathcal{C}\_1=0$ if $f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x})<0.5$ and $\mathcal{C}\_2=1$ if $f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x})>0.5$.

But this is somewhat questionable as an approach. MSE penalizes points that are far away from the result **before rounding**, even though they would be correct **after rounding**. This means that the line will likely not be a good line. 

With MSE, the "position" of the line defined by $f_{\Strain}$ will depend crucially on how many points are in each class, and where the points lie. This is not desirable for classification: instead of minimizing the cost function, we'd like for the fraction of misclassified cases to be small. The mean-squared error turns out to be only loosely related to this.

So instead of building classification as a special case of regression, let's take a look at some basic alternative ideas to perform classification.

### Nearest neighbor
In some cases it is reasonable to postulate that there is some spatial correlations between points of the same class: inputs that are "close" are also likely to have the same label. Closeness may be measured by Euclidean distance, for instance.

This can be generalized easily: instead of taking the single nearest neighbor, a process very prone to being swayed by outliers, we can take the $k$ nearest neighbors ([k-NN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm)), or a weighted linear combination of elements in the neighborhood ([smoothing kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother)).

But this idea fails miserably in high dimensions, where the geometry renders the idea of "closeness" meaningless: in a high-dimensional space, if we grow the area around a point, we're likely to see no one for a very long time, and then 💥, everyone. This is known as the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality). The idea also fails when we have too little data, especially in high dimensions, where the closest point may actually be far away and a very bad indicator of the local situation.

### Linear decision boundaries 
As a starting point, we can assume that decision boundaries are linear (hyperplanes). To keep things simple, we can assume that there is a separating hyperplane, i.e. a hyperplane so that no point in the training set is misclassified.

There may be many such lines, so which one do we pick? This may be a little hand-wavy, but the intuition is the most "robustness", or the one that offers the greatest "margin": we want to be able to "wiggle" the inputs as much as possible while keeping the numbers of misclassifications low. This idea will lead us to *support vector machines* (SVMs).

But the linear decision boundaries are limited, and in many cases too strong of an assumption. We can augment the feature vector with some non-linear functions, which is what we do with the kernel trick, which we will talk about later. Another option is to use neural networks to find an appropriate non-linear transform of the inputs.

### Optimal classification for a known generating model
To find a solution, we can gain some insights if we assume that we know the joint distribution $p(\pmb{x}, y)$ that created the data (where $y$ takes values in a discrete set $\mathcal{y}$). In practice, we don't know the model, but this is just a thought experiment. We can assume that the data was generated from a model $(\pmb{x}, y)\sim\mathcal{D}$, where $y=g(\pmb{x})+\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is noise.

Given the fact that there is noise, a perfect solution may not always be possible. But if we see an input $\pmb{x}$, how can we pick an optimal choice $\hat{y}(\pmb{x})$ for this distribution? We want to maximize the probability of guessing the correct label, so we should choose according to the rule:

$$
\hat{y}(\pmb{x}) = \argmax_{y\in\mathcal{Y}}{p(y\mid\pmb{x})}
$$

This is known as the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) criterion, since we maximize the posterior probability (the probability of a class label *after* having observed the input).

The probability of a correct guess is thus the average over all inputs of the MAP, i.e.:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\hat{y}(\pmb{x}) = y) = \int{p(\pmb{x})p(\hat{y}(\pmb{x})\mid \pmb{x})dx}
$$

In practice we of course do not know the joint distribution, but we could use this approach by using the data itself to learn the distribution (perhaps under the assumption that it is Gaussian, and just fitting the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ parameters).

## Logistic regression
Recall that [we discussed](#is-classification-a-special-case-of-regression) what happens if we look at binary classification as a regression. We also discussed that it is tempting to look at the predicted value as a probability (i.e. if the regression says 0.8, we could interpret it as 80% certainty of $\mathcal{C}\_1 = 0$ and 20% probability of $\mathcal{C}\_2 = 1$). But this leads to problems, as the predicted values may not be in $[0, 1]$, even largely surpassing these bounds, and this contributes to the error in MSE even though they indicate high certainty.

So the natural idea is to *transform* the prediction, which can take values in $(-\infty, \infty)$, into a true probability in $[0, 1]$. This is done by applying an appropriate function, one of which is the *logistic* function:

$$
\sigma(z) := \frac{e^z}{1+e^z}
$$

How do we use this? Let's consider binary classification, with labels 0 and 1. Given a training set, we learn a weight vector $\pmb{w}$, and a "shift" scalar $\pmb{w}_0$. 

Note that $w_0$ can, for the sake of simpler notation, be considered to be a constant feature in $\pmb{w}$. [As before](#multiple-linear-regression), we'll use this notation to keep things concise.

Given a new feature vector $\pmb{x}$, the *probability* of the class labels given $\pmb{x}$ are:

$$
\begin{align}
p(1 \mid \pmb{x}) & = \sigma(\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}) \\
p(0 \mid \pmb{x}) & = 1 - \sigma(\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}) \\
\end{align}
$$

This allows us to predict a certainty, which is a real value and not a label, which is why logistic regression is called regression, even though it is still part of a classification scheme. Indeed, we typically use logistic regression as the first step of a classifier.

### Training
To train the classifier, the intuition is that we'd like to maximize the likelihood of our weight vector explaining the data:

$$
\argmax_{\pmb{w}}{p(y, X \mid \pmb{w})}
$$

[As with MLE](#properties-of-mle), this is **consistent**, it gives us the correct model assuming we have enough data. Using the chain rule for probabilities, the probability becomes:

$$
p(y, X \mid \pmb{w}) = p(\pmb{X}\mid\pmb{w})p(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{X}, \pmb{w}) = p(\pmb{X})p(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{X}, \pmb{w})
$$

As we're trying to get the argmax over the weights, we can discard $p(X)$ as it doesn't depend on $\pmb{w}$. Therefore:

$$
\argmax_{\pmb{w}}{p(\pmb{y}, \pmb{X} \mid \pmb{w})} = \argmax_{\pmb{w}}{p(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{X}, \pmb{w})}
$$

Using the fact that the samples in the dataset are independent, and given the above formulation of the prior, we can express the maximum likelihood criterion for the general case (in the previous section, we had only done it for the binary case $N=2$):

$$
\begin{align}
p(\pmb{y} \mid \pmb{X}, \pmb{w})
    & = p(y_1, \dots, y_N \mid \pmb{x}_1, \dots, \pmb{x}_N, \pmb{w}) \\
    & = \prod_{n=1}^N{p(y_n \mid \pmb{x}_n, \pmb{w})} \\
    & = \prod_{n=1}^N{\sigma(x_n^T \pmb{w})^{y_n} (1-\sigma(x_n^T \pmb{w})^{1-y_n})} \\
\end{align}
$$

But this product is nasty, so we'll remove it by taking the log. We also multiply by $-1$, which means we also need to be careful about taking the minimum instead of the maximum. The resulting cost function is thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\cost{\pmb{w}}
    & = -\sum_{n=1}^N{\left[
        y_n \log{(\sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}))} + (1-y_n)\log{(1-\sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}))}
    \right]} \\
    & = \sum_{n=1}^N{\log{(1+\exp{(\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w})})} - y_n \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}}
    \tag{Log-Likelihood}\label{eq:log-likelihood}
\end{align}
$$

### Conditions of optimality
As we discuss above, we'd like to minimize the cost $\cost{\pmb{w}}$. Let's look at the stationary points of our cost function by computing its gradient and setting it to zero.

It just turns out that taking the derivative of the logarithm in the inner part of the sum above gives us the logistic function:

$$
\frac{\partial \log{(1+\exp{(x_n^T w)})}}{\partial x} = \sigma(x)
$$

Therefore, the whole derivative is:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla\cost{\pmb{w}} 
    & = \sum_{n=1}^N {\pmb{x}_n \sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w}) - y_n} \\
    & = \pmb{X}^T \left[ \sigma(\pmb{Xw}) - \pmb{y} \right]
\end{align}
$$

The matrix $\pmb{X}$ is $N\times N$; both $\pmb{y}$ and $\pmb{w}$ are column vectors of length $N$. Therefore, to simplify notation, we let $\sigma(\pmb{Xw})$ represent element-wise application of the sigmoid function on the size $N$ vector resulting from $\pmb{Xw}$.

There is no closed-form solution for this, so we'll discuss how to solve it in an iterative fashion by using gradient descent or the Newton method.

### Gradient descent
$\ref{eq:log-likelihood}$ is convex in the weight vector $\pmb{w}$. We can therefore do gradient descent on this cost function as we've always done:

$$
\pmb{w}^{(t+1)} := \pmb{w}^{(t)} - \gamma^{(t)}\nabla\cost(\pmb{w}^{(t)})
$$

### Newton's method
Gradient descent is a *first-order* method, using only the first derivative of the cost function. We can get a more powerful optimization algorithm using the second derivative. This is based on the idea of Taylor expansions. The order 2 Taylor expansion of the cost, around $\pmb{w}^*$, is:

$$
\cost{\pmb{w}} \approx \cost{\pmb{w}^*}^T(\pmb{w}-\pmb{w}^*) + \frac{1}{2}(\pmb{w}-\pmb{w}^*)^T H(\pmb{w}^*)(\pmb{w}-\pmb{w}^*)
$$

Where H denotes the Hessian, the $D\times D$ symmetric matrix with entries:

$$
H_{i, j} = \frac{\partial^2\cost{\pmb{w}}}{\partial w_i \partial w_j}
$$

#### Hessian of the log-likelihood
Let's compute this Hessian matrix. We've already computed the gradient of the cost function [in the section above](#conditions-of-optimality). Looking at the sum form (not the matrix form), we see that each term only depends on $\pmb{w}$ in the $\sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T w)$ term. Therefore, the Hessian associated to one term is:

$$
\pmb{x}_n(\nabla\sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w}))^T
$$

Given that the derivative of the sigmoid is $\sigma'(x) = \sigma(x)(1-\sigma(x))$, by the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule), each term of the sum gives rise to the Hessian:

$$
\pmb{x}_n\pmb{x}_n^T\sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w})(1 - \sigma(\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}))
$$

#### Newton's method
In this model, we'll assume that the Taylor expansion above denotes the cost function exactly instead of approximately. In other words, we're assuming strict equality $=$ instead of approximation $\approx$ as above. This is only an assumption; it isn't strictly true, but it's a decent approximation. Where does this take minimum value? To know that, let's set the gradient of the Taylor expansion to zero. This yields:

$$
H(\pmb{w}^*)^{-1} \nabla\cost{\pmb{w}^*} = \pmb{w}^* - \pmb{w}
$$

If we solve for $\pmb{w}$, this gives us an iterative algorithm for finding the optimum:

$$
w^{(t+1)} = w^{(t)} - H(w^{(t)})^{-1} \nabla\cost{w^{(t)}} \gamma^{(t)}
$$

In this iterative algorithm, our starting point, $w^{(0)}$ corresponds to $w^*$.

The above skips a few steps, and is just meant to give the intuition of how we get to our result. In any way, the important thing to remember is the formula for the descent, and the fact that the Hessian can be computed as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
H(w) 
    & = \sum_{n=1}^N{\nabla^2\mathcal{L}_n(w)} \\
    & = \sum_{n=1}^N{
        \underbrace{\pmb{X}_n \pmb{X}_n^T}_{D\times D}
        \sigma(x_n^T w)
        \bigl(1 - \sigma(x_n^T w) \bigr)
    } \\
\end{align}
$$

This can also be written as:

$$
H(w) = 
    \underbrace{\  X^T \ }_{D\times N}\ 
    \underbrace{\ S\ }_{N\times N}\ 
    \underbrace{\  X \ }_{N\times D}
$$

The S matrix is diagonal, where:

$$
S_{n, n} = \sigma(x_n^T w)\bigl(1 - \sigma(x_n^T w) \bigr)
$$

The trade-off for the Newton method is that while we need fewer iterations, each of them is more costly. In practice, which one to use depends, but at least we have another option with the Newton method.

### Regularized logistic regression
If the data is linearly separable, there is no finite weight vector. Running the iterative algorithm will make the weights diverge to infinity. To avoid this, we can regularize with a penalty term.

$$
\argmin_w{-\sum_{n=1}^N{\log{p(y_n \mid \pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w})}} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\pmb{w}}^2}
$$

## Generalized Linear Models
Previously, with [least squares](#least-squares), our data was of the form:

$$
y = x^T w + z, \quad \text{with } z\sim\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
$$

This is a D-linear model. When talking about generalized linear models, we're still talking about something linear, but we allow the noise $z$ to be something else than a Gaussian distribution.

### Motivation
The motivation for this is that while logistic regression allows for, say, binary outputs, we may want to have something equivalently computationally efficient for, say, $y\in\mathbb{N}$. To do so, we introduce different classes of distributions, called the *exponential family*, with which we can revisit logistic regression and get other properties.

This will be useful in adding a degree of freedom. Previously, we most often used linear models, in which we model the data as a line, plus zero-mean Gaussian noise. As we saw, this leads to least squares. When the data is more complex than a simple line, we saw that we could augment the features (e.g. with $x^2$, $x^3$), and still use a linear model. The idea was to augment the feature space $x$. This gave us an added degree of freedom, and allowed us to use linear models for higher-degree problems.

These linear models predicted the mean of the distribution from which we assumed the data to be sampled. When talking about mean here, we mean what we assume the data to be modeled after, without the noise. In this section, we'll see how we can use the linear model to predict a different quantity than the mean. This will allow us to add another degree of freedom, and use linear models to get other predictions than just the shape of the data.

We've actually already done this, without knowing it. In (binary) logistic regression, the probability of the classes was:

$$
\begin{align}
p(y = 1 \mid \eta) & = \sigma(\eta y) \\
p(y = 0 \mid \eta) & = 1 -  \sigma(\eta y) \\
\end{align}
$$

We're using $\eta$ as a shorthand for $\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}$, and will do so in this section. More compactly, we can write this in a single formula:

$$
p(y\mid\eta) = \frac{e^{\eta y}}{1 + e^\eta} = \exp{\left[
    \eta y - \log{(1 + e^\eta)}
\right]}, \qquad y\in\left\{0, 1\right\}
$$

Note that this linear model does not predict the mean, which we'll denote $\mu$ (don't get confused by this notation; $\mu$ is in general not a scalar, it represents the "real values" that the data is modeled after, without the noise). Instead, our linear model predicts $\eta = \pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}$, which is transformed into the mean by using the $\sigma$ function:

$$
\mu = \sigma(\eta)
$$

This relation between $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is known as the **link function**. It is a nonlinear function that makes it possible to use a linear model to predict something else than the mean $\mu$.

### Exponential family
In general, the form of a distribution in the exponential family is:

$$
p(y\mid\pmb{\eta}) = h(y)\exp{\left[\pmb{\eta}^T\phi(y) - A(\pmb{\eta})\right]}
$$

Let's take a look at the various components of this distribution:

- $\pmb{\eta}$ is a shorthand for $\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}$
- $\phi(y)$ is called a **sufficient statistics**. It's usually a vector. Its name stems from the fact that its empirical average is all we need to estimate $\pmb{\eta}$
- $A(\pmb{\eta})$ is the **log-partition function**, or the **cumulant**.

The domain of $y$ can be vary: we could choose $y\in\mathbb{R}$, $y\in\left\\{0, 1\right\\}$, $y\in\mathbb{N}$, etc. Depending on this, we may have to do sums or integrals in the following. 

We require that the probability be non-negative, so we need to ensure that $h(y) \ge 0$. Additionally, a probability distribution needs to integrate to 1, so we also require that that:

$$
\int_y{h(y)\exp{\left[\pmb{\eta}^T\phi(y) - A(\pmb{\eta})\right]}} dy = 1
$$

This can be rewritten to:

$$
\int_y{h(y)\exp{\left[\pmb{\eta}^T\phi(y)\right]}} dy = \exp{A(\eta)}
$$

The role of $A(\pmb{\eta})$ is thus only to ensure a proper normalization. To create a member of the exponential family, we can choose the factor $h(y)$, the vector $\phi(y)$ and the parameter $\pmb{\eta}$; the cumulant $A(\pmb{\eta})$ is then determined for each such choice, and ensures that the expression is properly normalized. From the above, it follows that $A(\pmb{\eta})$ is defined as:

$$
A(\eta) = \log{\left[\int_y{h(y)\exp{\left[\pmb{\eta}^T\phi(y) - A(\pmb{\eta})\right]}} dy\right]}
$$

We exclude the case where the integral is infinite, as we cannot compute a real $A(\eta)$ for that case.

#### Example: Bernoulli
The Bernoulli distribution is a member of the exponential family. Its probability density is given by:

$$
\begin{align}
p(y\mid\mu) 
    & = \mu^y(1-\mu)^{1-y}, \quad \text{where } \mu\in(0, 1) \\
    & = \exp{\left[
        \left( \log{\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}} \right) y +
        \log{(1 - \mu)}
     \right]} \\
    & = \exp{\left[\eta\phi(y) - A(\eta)\right]}
\end{align}
$$

The parameters are thus:

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(y) & = y \\
\eta    & = \log{\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}} \\
A(\eta) & = -\log{(1-\mu)}=\log{(1 + e^\eta)} \\
h(y)    & = 1
\end{align}
$$

Here, $\phi(y)$ is a scalar, which means that the family only depends on a single parameter. Note that $\eta$ and $\mu$ are linked:

$$
\eta = g(\mu) = \log{\frac{\mu}{1-\mu}} \iff \mu = g^{-1}(\eta) = \log{\frac{e^\eta}{1+e^\eta}} = \sigma(\eta)
$$

The link function is the same sigmoid function we encountered in logistic regression.

#### Example: Gaussian
The density of a Gaussian $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ is:

$$
p(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{-\frac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}},
\qquad \mu\in\mathbb{R}, 
\quad \sigma\in\mathbb{R}^+
$$

There are two parameters to choose in a Gaussian, $\mu$ and $\sigma$, so we can expect something of degree 2 in exponential form. Let's rewrite the above:

$$
\begin{align}
p(y) & = \exp{\left[
    -\frac{y^2}{2\sigma^2}
    + \frac{\mu y}{\sigma^2}
    - \underbrace{
        \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2}\log{(2\pi\sigma^2)}
    }_{A(\eta)}
\right]} \\
& = \exp{\left[
    \eta^T\phi(y) - A(\eta)
\right]}
\end{align}
$$

Where:

$$
\begin{align}
h(y) & = 1 \\

\phi(y) & = \begin{bmatrix}
    y   \\
    y^2 \\
\end{bmatrix} \\

\eta & = \begin{bmatrix}
    \eta_1 \\
    \eta_2 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2} \\
    -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \\
\end{bmatrix} \\

A(\eta) & = \frac{\mu^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2}\log{(2\pi\sigma^2)}
    = \frac{\eta_1^2}{4\eta_2} - \frac{1}{2}\log{(-\eta_2/\pi)}
\end{align}
$$

Indeed, this time $\phi(y)$ is a vector of dimension 2, which reflects that the distribution depends on 2 parameters. As the formulation of $\eta$ shows, we have a 1-to-1 correspondence to $\pmb{\eta}=(\eta_1, \eta_2)$ and the $(\mu, \sigma^2)$ parameters:

$$
\eta_1 = \frac{\mu}{\sigma^2},\ \eta_2 = -\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}
\quad \iff \quad
\mu = -\frac{\eta_1}{2\eta_2},\ \sigma^2 = -\frac{1}{2\eta_2}
$$

#### Properties
1. $A(\eta)$ is convex
2. $\nabla_\eta A(\eta) = \expect{\phi(y)}$
3. $\nabla_\eta^2 A(\eta) = \expect{\phi(y)^T\phi(y)} - \expect{\phi(y)}^T\expect{\phi(y)}$

Proofs are in the lecture notes.

#### Link function
As we've seen above, there is a relationship between the mean $\pmb{\mu} := \expect{\phi(y)}$ and $\pmb{\eta}$ using the link function $g$:

$$
\pmb{\eta} = g(\pmb{\mu}) \iff \pmb{\mu} = g^{-1}(\pmb{\eta})
$$

For a list of such functions, consult the chapter on Generalized Linear Models in [the KPM book](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/).

### Application in ML

#### Maximum Likelihood Parameter Estimation
Assume that we have samples composing our training set, $\Strain = \left\\{(x_n, y_n)\right\\}_{n=1}^N$ i.i.d. from some distribution, which we assume is some exponential distribution family. Assume we have picked a model, i.e. that we fixed $h(y)$ and $\phi(y)$, but that $\eta$ is unknown. How can we find an optimal $\eta$?

We said previously that $\phi(y)$ is a sufficient statistic, and that we could find $\eta$ from its empirical average; this is what we'll do here. We can use the maximum likelihood principle to find this parameter, meaning that we want to minimize log-likelihood:

$$
\begin{align}
\argmin{\mathcal{L}_{LL}(\pmb{\eta})} 
    & = -\log{(p(y \mid \pmb{\eta}))} \\
    & = \sum_{n=1}^N{\left(
        -\log{\left[h(y_n) - \pmb{\eta}^T\phi(y_n) + A(\pmb{\eta})\right]}
    \right)}
\end{align}
$$

This is a convex function in $\eta$: the $h(y)$ term does not depend on $\eta$, $\eta^T\phi(y_n)$ is linear, $A(\eta)$ has the [property of being convex](#properties-1).

If we assume that we have the link function already, we can get $\pmb{\eta}$ by setting the gradient of our exponential family to 0:

$$
\frac{1}{N} \nabla\cost{\pmb{\eta}}
    = -\left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N{\phi(y)} \right)
      + \expect{\phi(y)} 
    = 0
$$

Since $\pmb{\mu} := \expect{\phi(y)}$, we get:

$$
\pmb{\eta} = g^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N{\phi(y_n)} \right)
$$

#### Generalized linear models
If we assume that our samples follow the distribution of an exponential family, we can construct a *generalized linear model*. As we've explained previously, this is a generalization of the model we used for logistic regression.

For such a model, the maximum likelihood problem, as described above, is easy to solve. As we've noted above, the cost function is convex, so a greedy, iterative algorithm should work well. Let's look at the gradient of the cost:

$$
\nabla_{\pmb{w}}\cost{\pmb{w}} = - \sum_{n=1}^N {\pmb{x}_n \phi(y_n) - \pmb{x}_n A(\pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w})}
$$

Let's recall that the derivative of the cumulant is:

$$
\frac{\partial A(\eta)}{\partial \eta} = \expect{\phi(y)} = g^{-1}(\eta)
$$

Hence the gradient of the cost function is:

$$
\nabla_{\pmb{w}}\cost{\pmb{w}} = - \sum_{n=1}^N {\pmb{x}_n \phi(y_n) - \pmb{x}_n g^{-1}(\pmb{x}_n^T\pmb{w})}
$$

Setting this to zero gives us the condition of optimality. Using matrix notation, we can rewrite this sum as follows:

$$
\nabla\cost{\pmb{w}} = \pmb{X}^T\left( g^{-1}(\pmb{Xw}) - \phi(\pmb{y}) \right) = 0
$$

Note that this is a more general form of the formula we had [for logistic regression](#conditions-of-optimality).

## Nearest neighbor classifiers and the curse of dimensionality
For simplicity, let's assume that we're operating in a d-dimensional box, that is, in the domain $\chi = [0, 1]^d$. As always, we have a training set $\Strain=\left\\{(x_n, y_n)\right\\}$. 

### K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
Given a "fresh" input x, we can make a prediction using $\text{nbh}\_{S\_\text{train},\ k}(\pmb{x})$. This is a function returning the $k$ inputs in the training set that are closest to $\pmb{x}$.

For the regression problem, we can take the average of the k nearest neighbors:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{k}\sum_{n\in\text{nbh}_{\Strain,\ k}}{y_n}
$$

For binary classification, we take the majority element in the k-neighborhood. It's a good idea to pick k odd so that there is a clear winner.

$$
f(x) = \text{maj}\left\{y_n : n \in \text{nbh}_{\Strain,\ k}(x) \right\}
$$

If we pick a large value of k, then we are smoothing over a large area. Therefore, a large k gives us a simple model, with simpler boundaries, while a small k is a more complex model. In other words, complexity is inversely proportional to k.

If we pick k small we can expect a small bias but huge variance. If we pick a large k we can expect large bias but small variance.


### Analysis
We'll analyze the simplest setting, a binary KNN model (that is, there are only two output labels, 0 and 1). Let's start by simplifying our notation. We'll introduce the following function:

$$
\eta(\pmb{x}) = \mathbb{P}\left\{y=1\mid\pmb{x}\right\}
$$

This is the conditional probability that the label is 1, given that the input is $\pmb{x}$. If this probability is to be meaningful at all, we must have some correlation between the "position" x and the associated label; knowing the labels close by must give us some information. This means that we need an assumption on the distribution $\mathcal{D}$:

$$
\abs{\eta(\pmb{x}) - \eta(\pmb{x}')} \le \mathcal{c}\norm{\pmb{x} - \pmb{x}'}
\label{eq:lipschitz-bound}\tag{Lipschitz bound}
$$

On the right-hand side we have Euclidian distance. In other words, we ask that the conditional probability $\mathbb{P}\left\\{y=1\mid\pmb{x}\right\\}$, denoted by $\eta(x)$, be [Lipschitz continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipschitz_continuity) with Lipschitz constant $\mathcal{c}$. We will use this assumption later on to prove a performance bound for our KNN model.

Let's assume for a moment that we know the actual underlying distribution. This is not something that we actually know in practice, but is useful for deriving a formulation for the optimal model. Knowing the distribution probability distribution, our optimum decision rule is given by the classifier:

$$
f_*(\pmb{x}) = \mathbb{I}\left[ \eta(\pmb{x}) > \frac{1}{2} \right]
$$

The idea of this classifier is that with two labels, we'll pick the label that is likely to happen more than half of the time. The intuition is that if we were playing heads or tails and knew the probability in advance, we would always pick the option that has probability more than one half, and that is the best strategy we can use. This is known as the **Bayes classifier**, also called **maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifier**. It is optimal, in that it has the smallest probability of any classifier, namely:

$$
\cost{f_*} = \expectsub{\pmb{x}\sim\mathcal{D}}{
    \min{\left\{ \eta(\pmb{x}), 1-\eta(\pmb{x}) \right\}}
}
$$

Let's compare this to the probability of misclassification of the real model:

$$
\cost{f_{\Strain,\ k=1}} = \expect{\mathbb{I}\left[ f_{\Strain}(\pmb{x}) \ne y \right]}
$$

This tells us that the risk (that is, the error probability of our $k=1$ nearest neighbor classifier) is the above expectation. It's hard to find a closed form for that expectation, but we can place a bound on it by comparing the ideal, theoretical model to the actual model. We'll state the following lemma:

$$
\begin{align}
\cost{f_{\Strain}}
    & \le 2 \cost{f_*} + \mathcal{c} \expectsub{\Strain, \pmb{x}\sim\mathcal{D}}{\norm{\pmb{x} - \text{nbh}_{\Strain, 1}(\pmb{x})}} \\
    
    & \le 2 \cost{f_*} + 4\mathcal{c}\sqrt{d} N^{-\frac{1}{d+1}} \\
\end{align}
$$

Before we see where this comes from, let's just interpret it. The above gives us a bound on the real classifier, compared to the optimal one. The actual classifier is upper bounded by twice the risk of the optimal classifier (this is good), plus a geometric term reflecting dimensionality (it depends on $d$: this will cause us some trouble).

This second term of the sum is the average distance of a randomly chosen point to the nearest point in the training set, times the Lipschitz constant $\mathcal{c}$. It intuitively makes sense to incorporate this factor into our bound: if we are basing our prediction on a point that is very close, we're more likely to be right, and if it's far away, less so. If we're in a box of $[0, 1]^d$, then the distance between two corners would be $\sqrt{d}$ (by Pythagoras' theorem). The term $N^{-\frac{1}{d+1}}$ indicates that the closest data point may be closer than the opposite corner of the cube: if we have more data, we'll probably not have to go that far. However, for large dimensions, we need much more data to have something that'll probably be close.

Let's prove where this geometric term comes from. Let's consider the cube $[0, 1]^d$, the space of inputs containing $\pmb{x}$. If we cut this large cube into small cubes of side length $\epsilon$. Consider the small cube containing $\pmb{x}$. If we are lucky, this small cube also contains a neighboring data point at distance at most $\sqrt{d}\epsilon$ (as per Pythagoras' theorem, as stated above). However, if we're less lucky, the closest neighbor may be at the other corner of the big cube, at distance $\sqrt{d}$. So what is the probability of a point not having a neighbor in its small $\epsilon$ cube?

Let's denote the probability of $\pmb{x}$ landing in a particular box by $\mathbb{P}_i$. The chance that none of the N training points are in the box is $(1-\mathbb{P}_i)^N$. We don't know the distribution $\mathcal{D}$, so we can't really express $\mathbb{P}_i$ in a closed form, but that doesn't matter, this notation allows us to abstract over that. The rest of the proof is calculus, carefully choosing the right scaling for $\epsilon$ in order to get a good bound.

Now, let's understand where the term $2\cost{f_*}$ comes from. If we flip two coins, $y$ and $y'$, what is the probability of the outcome being different?

$$
\mathbb{P}\left\{y \ne y' \right\} = 2p(1-p)
$$

Now, let's consider two points $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{x}'$, both elements of $[0, 1]^d$. Their labels are $y$ and $y'$, respectively. The probability of these two labels being different is roughly the same as above (although the probabilities of the two events may not be the same in general):

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{P}\left\{ y \ne y'\right\}
    =   & \eta(\pmb{x})(1-\eta{\pmb{x'}}) + \eta(\pmb{x'})(1-\eta{\pmb{x}}) \\
    =   & 2\eta(\pmb{x})(1-\eta(\pmb{x})) + (2\eta(\pmb{x})-1)(\eta(\pmb{x})-\eta(\pmb{x}')) \\
    \le & 2\eta(\pmb{x})(1-\eta(\pmb{x})) + (\eta(\pmb{x}) - \eta(\pmb{x}')) \\
    \le & 2\eta(\pmb{x})(1-\eta(\pmb{x})) + \mathcal{c}\norm{\pmb{x}-\pmb{x}'}
\end{align}
$$

The last step uses $\ref{eq:lipschitz-bound}$.

Therefore, we can confirm the following bound:

$$
\mathcal{P}\left\{ y\ne y' \right\} \le  2\eta(\pmb{x})(1-\eta{\pmb{x}}) + \mathcal{c}\norm{\pmb{x} - \pmb{x}'}
$$

But we are still one step away from explaining how we can compare this to the optimal estimator. In the above, we derived a bound for two labels being different. How is this related to our KNN model? The probability of getting a wrong prediction from KNN with $k=1$ (which we denoted $\expectsub{\Strain}{\cost{f_{\Strain}}}$) is the probability of the predicted label being different from the solution label. 

We get to our lemma by the following reasoning:

$$
2\eta(\pmb{x})(1-\eta{\pmb{x}}) 
    \le 2\min{\left\{ \eta(\pmb{x}), 1-\eta(\pmb{x}) \right\}}
    = 2\cost{f_*}
$$

Additionally, the average of the term $\mathcal{c}\norm{\pmb{x} - \pmb{x}'}$ is $\mathcal{c}\expectsub{\Strain, \pmb{x}\sim\mathcal{D}}{\norm{\pmb{x} - \text{nbh}_{\Strain, 1}(\pmb{x})}}$

If we had assumed that it was a ball instead of a cube, we would've gotten slightly different results. But that's besides the point: the main insight from this is that it depends on the dimension, and that for low dimensions at least, we still have a fairly good classifier. But finding a closest neighbor in high dimension can quickly become meaningless.


## Support Vector Machines
### Definition
Let's re-consider binary classification. In the following it will be more convenient to consider $y_n\in\set{\pm 1}$. This is equivalent to what we've done previously, under the mapping $0 \mapsto -1$ and $1\mapsto 1$. Note that this mapping can be done continuously in the range $[0, 1] \mapsto [-1, 1]$ by computing $\tilde{y}_n = \frac{1}{2}(y_n + 1)$.

Previously, we used MSE or logistic loss. MSE is symmetric, so something being positive or negative is punished at an equal rate. With logistic regression, we always have a loss, but its value is asymmetric, shrinking the further we go right.

If we instead use hinge loss (as defined below), with an additional regularization term, we get **Support Vector Machines** (SVM).

$$
\text{Hinge}(z, y) =  [1-yz]_+ = \max{\left\{ 0, 1-yz \right\}}
$$

Here, we use $z$ as shorthand for $\pmb{x}^T \pmb{w}$. The function multiplies the prediction with the actual label, which produces a positive result if they are of the same sign, and a negative result if they have different signs (this is why we wanted our labels in $\set{\pm 1}$). When the prediction is correct and above one, $1-yz$ becomes negative, and hinge loss returns 0. This makes hinge loss a linear function when predictions are incorrect or below one; it does not punish correct predictions above one, which pushes us to give predictions that we can be very confident about (above one).

![Graph of hinge loss, MSE and logistic](/images/ml/hinge-mse-logistic.png)

SVMs correspond to the following optimization problem:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}}{\sum_{n=1}^N{\left[ 1 - y_n \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}\right]_+} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\pmb{w}}^2}
$$

What does this optimization problem correspond to, intuitively?

![Margin of a dataset](/images/ml/margin.png)

In the figure above, the pink region represents the "margin" created by the SVM. The center of the margin is dictated by $\pmb{w}$, the normal vector to the separating hyperplane; the direction is given by the direction of the vector $\pmb{w}$, and the width is $2/\norm{\pmb{w}}$.

Points inside the margin are feature vectors $\pmb{x}$ for which $\abs{\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}} < 1$. These points incur a cost with hinge loss. Any points outside the margin, for which $\abs{\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}} \ge 1$, do not incur any cost. Thus, depending on the $\pmb{w}$ that we choose, the orientation and size of the margin will change; there will be a different number of points in it, and the cost will change.

How can we pick a good margin? Let's assume $\lambda$ is small; we won't define that further, the main point is just we pick one with the following priorities (in order):

1. We want a separating hyperplane
2. We want a scaling of $\pmb{w}$ so that no point of the data is in the margin
3. We want the margin to be as wide as possible

With conditions 1 and 2, we can ensure that there is no cost incurred in the first expression (the sum over $[1 - y\_n \pmb{x}\_n^T \pmb{w}]\_+$). The third condition is ensured by the fact that we're minimizing $\norm{\pmb{w}}^2$. Since the size of the margin is inversely proportional to that, we're maximizing the margin.

We've introduced SVMs for the general case, where the data is not necessarily linearly separable, which is the *soft-margin* formulation. In the *hard-margin* formulation, the data is linearly separable by a separating hyperplane. Maximizing the margin size in the hard-margin formulation implies that some points will lie exactly on the margin boundary. These points are called **support vectors**. For the soft-margin case, this interpretation becomes a little more muddled.


### Alternative formulation: Duality
Now that we know what function we're optimizing, let's look at how we can optimize it efficiently. The function is convex, and has a subgradient in $\pmb{w}$, which means we can use SGD with subgradients. This is good news! We'll discuss an alternative, but equivalent formulation via the concept of *duality*, which can lead us to a more efficient implementation in some cases. More importantly though, the dual problem can point us to a more general formulation, called the [kernel trick](#kernel-trick).

Let's say that we're interested in minimizing a cost function $\cost{\pmb{w}}$. Let's assume this can be defined through an auxiliary function $G$, such that:

$$
\cost{\pmb{w}} = \max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})}
$$

The minimization in question is thus:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}}{\max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})}}
$$

We call this the **primal problem**. In some cases though, it may be easier to find this in the other direction:

$$
\max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{\min_{\pmb{w}}{G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})}}
$$

We call this the **dual problem**. This leads us to a few questions:

#### How do we find a suitable function G?
There's a general theory on this topic (see [Nonlinear Programming](http://www.athenasc.com/nonlinbook.html) by Dimitri Bertsekas). In the case of SVMs though, the finding the function G is rather straightforward, once we restate the hinge loss as follows:

$$
[z]_+ = \max{\left\{ 0, z \right\}} = \max_{\alpha}{\alpha z}, \qquad \text{with } \alpha\in[0, 1]
$$

The SVM problem then becomes:

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}}{\max_{\pmb{\alpha}\in[0, 1]^N}{
    \sum_{n=1}^N{
        \alpha_n (1 - y_n \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w})
    } + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\pmb{w}}^2
}} = \min_{\pmb{w}}{\max_{\pmb{\alpha}\in[0, 1]^N}{
    G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})}
}
$$

Note that G is convex in $\pmb{w}$, and linear (hence concave) in $\pmb{\alpha}$.

#### When is it OK to switch min and max? 
It is always true that:

$$
\max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{\min_{\pmb{w}}{G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})}}
\le
\min_{\pmb{w}}{\max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})}}
$$

This is proven by:

$$
\begin{align}
\min_{\pmb{w}'}{G(\pmb{w}', \pmb{\alpha})} 
& \le G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha}) 
  \quad \forall \pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha} 
& \iff \\

\max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{\min_{\pmb{w}'}{G(\pmb{w}', \pmb{\alpha})}} 
& \le \max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha})} 
  \quad \forall \pmb{w} 
& \iff \\

\max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{\min_{\pmb{w}'}{G(\pmb{w}', \pmb{\alpha})}} 
& \le \min_{\pmb{w}} \max_{\pmb{\alpha}}{G(w, \pmb{\alpha})} 
& \\
\end{align}
$$

Equality is achieved when the function looks like a saddle: when $G$ is a continuous function that is convex in $\pmb{w}$, concave in $\pmb{\alpha}$, and the domains of both are compact and convex.

![Saddle function](/images/ml/saddle.png)

For SVMs, this condition is fulfilled, and the switch between min and max can be done. The alternative formulation of SVMs is:

$$
\max_{\pmb{\alpha}\in[0, 1]^N}{\min_{\pmb{w}}{
    \sum_{n=1}^N{
        \alpha_n (1 - y_n \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w})
    } + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\pmb{w}}^2
}}
\label{eq:svm-dual}\tag{Dual problem}
$$

We can take the derivative with respect to $\pmb{w}$:

$$
\nabla_{\pmb{w}}G(\pmb{w}, \pmb{\alpha}) 
    = -\sum_{n=1}^N{\alpha_n y_n \pmb{x}_n + \lambda\pmb{w}}
$$

We'll set this to zero to find a formulation of $\pmb{w}$ in terms of $\alpha$. We get:

$$
\pmb{w}(\pmb{\alpha}) = \frac{1}{\lambda}\sum_{n=1}^N{\alpha_n y_n \pmb{x}_n} = \frac{1}{\lambda}\pmb{X}^T\pmb{Y\alpha}
$$

Where $\pmb{Y} := \text{diag}(\pmb{y})$. If we plug this into $\ref{eq:svm-dual}$, we get the following dual problem, in quadratic form:

$$
\begin{align}
&   \max_{\pmb{\alpha}\in[0, 1]^N}{
    \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}y_n \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{X}^T\pmb{Y}\pmb{\alpha}) + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\frac{1}{\lambda}\pmb{X}^T\pmb{Y}\pmb{\alpha}}^2
} \\
& = \max_{\pmb{\alpha}\in[0, 1]^N}{
    \pmb{\alpha}^T\pmb{1} - \frac{1}{2\lambda}\pmb{\alpha}^T\pmb{YXX}^T\pmb{Y\alpha}
} \label{eq:svm-quadratic-form} \tag{Quadratic form}

#### When is the dual easier to optimize than the primal? 
1. When the dual is a differentiable quadratic problem (as SVM is). This is a problem that takes the same $\ref{eq:svm-quadratic-form}$ as above. In this case, we can optimize by using **coordinate descent** (or more precisely, ascent, as we're searching for the maximum). Crucially, this method only changes one $\alpha_n$ variable at a time.
2. In the $\ref{eq:svm-quadratic-form}$ above, the data enters the formula in the form $\pmb{K} = \pmb{XX}^T$. This is called the **kernel**. We say this formulation is *kernelized*. Using this representation is called the *kernel trick*, and gives us some nice consequences that we'll discuss later.
3. Typically, the solution $\pmb{\alpha}$ is sparse, being non-zero only in the training examples that are instrumental in determining the decision boundary. If we recall how we defined $\alpha$ as an alternative formulation of $[z]_+$, we can see that there are three distinct cases to consider:
    1. Examples that lie on the correct side, and outside the margin, for which $\alpha_n = 0$. These are **non-support vectors**
    2. Examples that are on the correct side and just on the margin, for which $y_n \pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w} = 1$, so $\alpha_n \in (0, 1)$. These $\pmb{x}_n$ are **essential support vectors**
    3. Examples that are strictly within the margin, or on the wrong side have $\alpha_n = 1$, and are called **bound support vectors**

### Kernel trick
We saw previously that our data only enters the problem in the form of a kernel, $\pmb{K} = \pmb{XX}^T$. We'll see now that when we're using the kernel, we can easily go to a much larger dimensional space (even infinite dimensional space) without adding any complexity. This isn't always applicable though, so we'll also see which kernel functions are admissible for this trick.

#### Alternative formulation of ridge regression
Let's recall that least squares is a special case of ridge regression (where $\lambda = 0$). Ridge regression corresponds to the following optimization problem:

$$
\pmb{w}^* = \min_{\pmb{w}}{\sum_{n=1}^N{(y_n - \pmb{x}_n^T w)^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\pmb{w}}^2}}
$$

We saw that the solution has a closed form:

$$
\pmb{w}^* = (\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X} + \lambda\pmb{I}_D)^{-1} \pmb{X}^T y
$$

We claim that this can be alternatively written as:

$$
\pmb{w}^* = 
    \pmb{X}^T
    (\underbrace{\pmb{XX}^T\pmb{X} +  \lambda\pmb{I}_N}_{N\times N})^{-1}
    y
$$

The original formulation's runtime is $\mathcal{O}(D^3 + ND^2)$, while ther alternative is $\mathcal{O}(N^3 + DN^2)$. Which is more efficient depends on $D$ and $N$.

{% details Proof %}
We can prove this formulation by using the following identity. If we let $P$ be an $N\times M$ matrix, and $Q$ be $M\times N$. Then:

$$
P(QP + I_M) = PQP + P = (PQ + I_N)P
$$

Assuming that $(QP + I_M)$ and $(PQ + I_N)$ are invertible, we have the identity:

$$
(PQ+I_N)^{-1}P = P(QP+I_M)^{-1}
$$

To derive the formula, we can let $P = X^T$ and $Q = \frac{1}{\lambda}X$.
{% enddetails %}

#### Representer theorem
The representer theorem generalizes what we just saw about least squares. For any cost function $\mathcal{L}_n$ 

$$
\min_{\pmb{w}}{\sum_{n=1}^N{
    \mathcal{L}_n(\pmb{x}_n^T \pmb{w}, y_n) + \frac{\lambda}{2}\norm{\pmb{w}}^2
}}
$$

there exists $\pmb{\alpha^\*}$ such that $\pmb{w}^\* = \pmb{X}^T \pmb{\alpha}^\*$.

#### Kernelized ridge regression
The above theorem gives us a new way of searching for $\pmb{w}^\*$: we can first search for $\pmb{\alpha^\*}$, which might be easier, and then get back to the optimal weights by using the identity $\pmb{w}^\* = \pmb{X}^T \pmb{\alpha}^\*$.

Therefore, for ridge regression, we can equivalently optimize our alternative formula in terms of $\alpha$:

$$
\pmb{\alpha}^* = \argmin_{\pmb{\alpha}}{\frac{1}{2}\pmb{\alpha}^T(\pmb{XX}^T + \lambda I_N)\pmb{\alpha} - \pmb{\alpha}^T \pmb{y}}
$$

We see that our data enters in kernel form. How do we get the solution to this minimization problem? We can, as always, take the gradient of the cost function according to $\pmb{\alpha}$ and set it to zero:

$$
\nabla_{\alpha}\cost{\alpha} = (\pmb{XX}^T + \lambda I)\alpha - y = 0 
$$

Solving for $\alpha$ results in:

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha^* & = (\pmb{XX}^T + \lambda I_N)^{-1} y \\
\pmb{w}^* & = X^T(\pmb{XX}^T + \lambda I_N)^{-1} y
\end{align}
$$

We've effectively gotten back to our claimed alternative formulation for the optimal weights.

#### Kernel functions
The kernel is defined as $K = XX^T$. We'll call this the linear kernel. The elements are defined as:

$$
K_{i, j} = \pmb{x}_i^T\pmb{x}_j
$$

Assume that we had first augmented the feature space with $\phi(\pmb{x})$; the elements of the kernel would then be:

$$
K_{i, j} = \phi(\pmb{x}_i)^T\phi(\pmb{x}_j)
$$

Using this formulation allows to keep the size of $K$ the same, regardless of how much we augment. In other words, we can now solve a problem where the size is independent of the feature space.

We'll see a few examples where we augment the feature space by a few dimensions, which of course isn't terribly useful (going to $N\times N$ just to be able to augment the feature space by 3 is rarely a good trade-off), but if we can augment our feature space by a lot and still keep our kernel finite (as we'll see later with RBF kernels), then the trade-off becomes worth it.

The feature augmentation goes from $x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d$ to $\phi(x_n) \in \mathbb{R}^{d'}$ with $d' \gg d$, or even to an infinite dimension. Depending on $d'$, it may or may not be worth it.

#### Kernel trick
The big advantage of using kernels is that rather than first augmenting the feature space and then computing the kernel, we can do both steps together, and we can do it more efficiently.

Let's define a kernel function $\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x}')$. We'll let entries in the kernel $K$ be defined by:

$$
K_{i, j} = \kappa(\pmb{x}_i, \pmb{x}_j)
$$

We can pick different kernel functions and get some interesting results. If we pick the right kernel, it can be equivalent to augmenting the features with some $\phi(\pmb{x})$, and then computing the inner product:

$$
\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x}') = \phi(\pmb{x})^T\phi(\pmb{x}')
$$

Let's take a look at a few examples of choices for $\kappa$ and see what happens:

##### Radial basis function
The following kernel corresponds to an infinite feature map:

$$
\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x}') = \exp{\left[-\frac{1}{2}(\pmb{x} - \pmb{x}')^T(\pmb{x} - \pmb{x}')\right]}
$$

This is called the *radial basis function* (RBF) kernel. Let's look at this in more detail. Consider the special case in which $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{x}'$ are scalars; we'll look at the Taylor expansion of the function:

$$
\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x}') = e^{-(x)^2} e^{-(x')^2} \sum_{k=0}^K{\frac{2^k(x)^k(x')^k}{k!}}
$$

We can think of this infinite sum as the dot-product of two infinite vectors, whose $k$-th components are equal to, respectively:

$$
e^{-(x)^2} \sqrt{\frac{2^k}{k!}} (x)^k
\quad \text{and} \quad
e^{-(x')^2} \sqrt{\frac{2^k}{k!}} (x')^k
$$

#### New kernel functions from old ones
We can simply construct a new kernel as a linear combination of old kernels:

$$
\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) = a\kappa_1(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) + b\kappa_2(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}), \quad \forall a, b \ge 0 \\

\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) = \kappa_1(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) \kappa_2(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) \\

\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) = \kappa_1(f(\pmb{x}), f(\pmb{x'})) \\
$$

Proofs are in the lecture notes. If we accept these, we can combine them to prove much more complex kernel functions.

### Properties of kernels
A kernel function must be an inner-product in some feature space. Mercer's condition states that this is true iff the following conditions are fulfilled:

1. $K$ should be symmetric, i.e. $\kappa(\pmb{x}, \pmb{x'}) = \kappa(\pmb{x'}, \pmb{x})$
2. For any arbitrary input set $\left\\{\pmb{x}_n\right\\}$ and all $N$, $K$ should be positive semi-definite

Todo make sure that kernel section is complete

## Unsupervised learning
So far, all we've done is supervised learning: we've gone from a training set with features vectors and labels, and we wanted to output a classification or a regression.

There is a second very important framework in ML called *unsupervised* learning. Here, the training set is only composed of the feature vectors:

$$
S_{\text{train}} = \left\{ (\pmb{x}) \right\}_{n=1}^N
$$

We would then like to learn from this dataset without having access to the training labels. The two main directions in unsupervised learning:

- Representation learning & feature learning
- Density estimation & generative models 

Let's take a bird's eye view of the existing techniques through some examples.

1. **Matrix factorization**: can be used for both supervised and unsupervised. We'll give an example for each
    1. **Netflix, collaborative filtering**: this is an example of supervised learning. We have a large, sparse matrix with rows of users, columns of  movies, containing ratings. If we can approximate the matrix reasonably well by a matrix of rank one (i.e. outer product of two vectors), then this extracts useful features both for the users and the movies; it might group movies by genres, and users by type.
    2. **word2vec**: this is an example of unsupervised learning. The idea is to map every word from a large corpus to a vector $w_i \in \mathbb{R}^K$, where K is relatively large. This would allow us to represent natural language in some numeric space. To get this, we build a matrix $N\times N$, with $N$ being the number of words in the corpus. We then factorize the matrix by means of two matrices of rank $K$ to give us the desired representation. The results are pretty astounding, as [this article](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec) shows; closely related words are close in the vector space, and it's easy to get a mapping from concepts to associated concepts (say, countries to capitals).
2. **PCA and SVD** (Principle Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition): Features are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some d. If we wanted to "compress" this down to one dimension (this doesn't have to be an existing feature, it could be a newly generated one from the existing ones), we could ask that the variance of the projected data be as large as possible. This will lead us to PCA, which we compute using SVD.
3. **Clustering**: to reveal structure in data, we can cluster points given some similarity measure (e.g. Euclidean distance) and the number of clusters we want. We can also ask clusters to be hierarchical (clusters within clusters).
4. **Generative models**: a generative model models the distribution of the data
    1. **Auto-encoders**: these are a form of compression algorithm, trying to find good weights for encoding and compressing the data
    2. **Generative Adversarial Networks** (GANs): the idea is to use two neural nets, one that tries to generate samples that look like the data we get, and another that tries to distinguish the real samples from the fake ones. The aim is that after sufficient training, a classifier cannot distinguish real samples from artificial ones. If we achieve that, then we have built a good model.

### K-Means
A common algorithm for unsupervised learning is called K-means (also called vector quantization in signal processing). The aim of this algorithm is to cluster the data: we want to find a partition such that every point is exactly one group, such that within a group, the (Euclidean) distance between points is much smaller than across the groups.

In K-means, we find these clusters in terms of cluster centers (also called means). Each center dictates the partition: which cluster a point belongs to depends on which center is closest to the point. In other words, we're minimizing the distance over all $N$ points and $K$ clusters:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{K-means}} = \min_{\left\{\mu_k\right\}, \left\{z_{nk}\right\}}{\sum_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K{z_{nk} \norm{x_n - \mu_k}^2}}}
$$

The $z_{nk}$ is the k<sup>th</sup> number in the $z_n$ vector, which is a one-hot vector encoding the cluster assignment: if we're looking at the n<sup>th</sup> datapoint, we have a vector $z_n$ of length K consisting of zeros and ones, which has exactly one 1. Mathematically, we can write this constraint as:

$$
z_{nk} \in \left\{0, 1\right\}, \quad \sum_{k=1}^K{z_{nk}} = 1
$$

This formulation of the problem gives rise to two conditions, which will give us an intuitive algorithm for solving this iteratively. We see that there are two sets of variables to optimize under: $\mu_k$ and $z_{nk}$. The idea is to fix one and optimize the other.

First, let's fix the centers $\left\\{\mu_k \right\\}$ and work on the assignments. To minimize the sum:

$$
z_{nk} = \begin{cases}
    1, & k = \argmin_{k'}{\norm{x_n - \mu_{k'}}^2} \\
    0, & \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

Intuitively, this means that we're grouping the points by the closest center.

Having computed this, we can fix the assignments $z_{nk}$ to compute optimal centers $\mu_k$. These centers should correspond to the center of the cluster. This minimizes the distance that all points can have to the center.

$$
\mu_k = \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N{z_{nk} x_n}}{\sum_{n=1}^N{z_{nk}}}
$$

Note that in this formulation, $k$ is fixed, and $n$ varies in the sum. This gives us some kind of average: the sum of all the positions of the points in the cluster, divided by the number of points in the cluster.

How did we get to this formulation? If we take the derivative of the cost function and set it to zero, and then solve it for $\mu_k$, we get to the above.

$$
\nabla_{\mu_k}\mathcal{L}_{\text{K-means}} = \sum_{n=1}^N{2z_{nk}\mu_k - 2z_{nk}x_n} = 0 
$$

Solving this confirms that taking the average position in the cluster indeed is the best way to optimize our cost.

These observations give rise to an algorithm:

1. Initialize the centers $\left\\{\mu_k^{(0)}\right\\}$. In practice, the algorithm's convergence may depend on this choice, but there is no general best strategy. As such, they can in general be initialized randomly.
2. Repeat until convergence:
    1. Choose $z^{(t+1)}$ given $\mu^{(t)}$
    2. Choose $\mu^{(t+1)}$ given $z^{(t+1)}$

Each of these two steps will only make the partitioning better, if possible. Still, this may get stuck at a local minimum, there's no guarantee of it converging to the optimum; it's a greedy algorithm.

#### Coordinate descent interpretation
There are other ways to look at K-means. One way is to think of it as a coordinate descent, minimizing a cost function by finding parameters $\mu$ and $z$. This doesn't actually give us much new insight, but it's a nice way to think about it.

#### Matrix factorization interpretation
Another way to think about it is as a matrix factorization. We can rewrite K-means as the minimization of the following:

$$
\min_{M, Z}{\norm{X^T - M Z^T}_F}
$$

A few notes on this notation:

- $X$ is as always our data matrix; since it's transpossed, it's $D\times N$. 
- $M$ is a $D\times K$ representing the mean; each column represents a different center. 
- $Z^T$ is the $K\times N$ assignment matrix; it picks a single column from the means. This means that exactly one element of each row is 1.
- The norm here is [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm) (the sum of the squares of all elements in matrix).

#### Probabilistic interpretation
A probabilistic interpretation of K-means will lead us to GMMs. Having a probabilistic approach is useful because it allows us to account for the model that we think generated the data.

The assumption is that the samples $x_n$ come from one out of $K$ D-dimensional Gaussian distributions. These distributions are assumed to have means $\left\\{ \mu_k \right\\}$, and a covariance matrix that is the identity matrix (that is, variance 1 in each dimension, and the dimensions are i.i.d).

Let's write down the likelihood. The Gaussian density function of a sample is:

$$
p(x_n \mid \mu, z) = \prod_{k=1}^K{\left(
    \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}} \exp{\frac{-\norm{x_n - \mu_k}^2}{2}}
\right)^{z_{nk}}}
$$

The density assuming that we know that the points are from a given $k$ is what's inside of the large parentheses, but seeing that we don't know from which of the K distribution the point is from, we have to take the product over all $z_{nk}$ (this is the same trick we used previously; it allows us to cancel all other sources than the assigned one).

Now, if we want to this for the whole set instead of for a single sample, assuming that the samples are i.i.d, we can write this as a product:

$$
\prod_{n=1}^N{p(x_n \mid \mu, z)} = \prod_{n=1}^N{\prod_{k=1}^K{\left(
    \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{D/2}} \exp{\frac{-\norm{x_n - \mu_k}^2}{2}}
\right)^{z_{nk}}}}
$$

This is the likelihood, which we want to maximize. We could equivalently minimizing the log-likelihood. We'll also remove the constant factor as it has no influence on our minimization.

$$
\begin{align}
-\log{\prod_{n=1}^N{p(x_n \mid \mu, z)}} 
    & = -\log{\prod_{n=1}^N{\prod_{k=1}^K{\left(
        \exp{\frac{-\norm{x_n - \mu_k}^2}{2}}
    \right)^{z_{nk}}}}} \\
    & = \sum_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K{z_{nk} \norm{x_n - \mu_k}^2}}
\end{align}
$$

And this is of course the cost function we were optimizing before.

### Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
So now that we've expressed K-means from a probabilistic view, let's view the probabilistic generalization, which is called a Gaussian Mixture Model.

To generalize the previous, what if our data comes from Gaussian sources that aren't perfectly circularly symmetric, that don't have the identity matrix as variance? A more general solution is to allow for a general covariance matrix $\Sigma$. This will add another parameter that we need optimize over, but can help us more accurately model the data.

Another extension is that we were previously forced to be either from one or another distribution. This is called hard clustering. We can generalize this to soft clustering, where a point can be associated to multiple clusters. In soft clustering, we model $z_n$ as a random variable taking values in $\left\\{1, \dots, K\right\\}$, instead of a one-hot vector. 

This assignment is given by a certain distribution. We denote the a priori probability that the sample comes from the k<sup>th</sup> Gaussian, $\mathcal{N}(\mu_k, \Sigma_k)$ by $\pi_k$:

$$
P(z_n = k) = \pi_k
$$

What we're trying to minimize in this extended model is then (still under the assumption that the data is independently distributed from K samples):

$$
\prod_{n=1}^N{p(z_n \mid \pi) \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid z_n, \mu, \Sigma)}
$$

This is the model that we'll use. It's not something that we aim to prove or not prove, it's just what we chose to base ourselves on. We'll want to optimize over $\mu$ and $\Sigma$. 

The $z_n$ variable is what's known as a **latent variable**; it's not something that we observe directly, it's just something that we use to make our model more complex. If we're not interested in this, what we can do is integrate over the latent variables. This gives us:

$$
\prod_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}}
$$

This is a weighted sum of all the models. The weights sum up to one, so we have a valid density. In other words, we are now able to model much more complex distribution functions by building up our distribution from K Gaussian distributions; we can optimize the fit of the model by changing the weights and optimizing the log likelihood of the above, which is:

$$
-\sum_{n=1}^N{\log{\left( \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)} \right)}}
$$

This can be optimized over $\pi_k, \mu_k, \Sigma_k$. Unfortunately, we now have the log of a sum of Gaussians (which are exponentials), which isn't a very nice formula. We'll use this as an excuse to talk about another algorithm, the EM algorithm.

### EM algorithm
The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm provides us with a general method to tackle this sort of problem. 

Previously, in GMM, we had set of parameters:

$$
\theta^{(t)} = \set{
    \set{\mu_k^{(t)}}_{k=1}^K, 
    \set{\Sigma_k^{(t)}}_{k=1}^K, 
    \set{\pi_k^{(t)}}_{k=1}^K, 
}
$$

Recall that we want to maximize:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N{\log{\left( \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)} \right)}}
$$

In this problem, we're maximizing the cost function (instead of minimizing it as we're used to). This is strictly equivalent to minimizing the negative of this, and we're using maximizing and minimizing the negative equivalently.

We're maximizing over all choices of $\theta$. At every step, we try to go from a set of parameters $\theta^{(k)}$ to a better set of parameters $\theta^{(k+1)}$.

The EM algorithm consists of optimizing for $q_{nk}$ and $\theta$ alternatively.

#### Expectation step
In the expectation step, we compute how well we're doing:

$$
\cost{\theta^{(t)}} = \sum_{n=1}^N{ \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k) }
$$

We can then choose the new $q_{nk}$ values:

$$
q_{nk}^{(t+1)} = \frac{
    \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
}{
    \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}
}
$$

This gives us a new lower bound on the cost:

$$
\cost{\theta^{(t+1)}} \ge \sum_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K}{q_{nk}^{(t+1)} \log{\left(
    \frac{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}{q_{nk}^{(t+1)}}
\right)}}
$$

Getting a lower bound means that we have a monotonically non-decreasing cost over the steps $t$. Again, this is a good guarantee because we're maximizing over the cost: it tells us that our E-step improves at every step.

This value is actually the expected value, hence the name of the E-step. We'll see this in the interpretation section below.

{% details Derivation %}
Consider any probability distribution $q_n^{(t)}$. Since it is a probability distribution, we have:

$$
q_{nk}^{(t)} \ge 0, \quad \sum_{k=1}^K{q_{nk}^{(t)}} = 1
$$

Due to the concavity of the log function, and because the $q_{nk}$ sum up to 1 (being a probability distribution), we can apply [Jensen's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality) recursively to the cost function to get:

$$
\begin{align}
\log{\left( \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)} \right)} 
    & = \log{\left(
        \sum_{k=1}^K{
            q_{nk}^{(t)}
            \frac{
                \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
            }{
                q_{nk}^{(t)}
            }
        } \right)} \\
    
    & \ge \sum_{k=1}^K{
        q_{nk}^{(t)} 
        \log{\frac{
            \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
        }{
            q_{nk}^{(t)}
        }}
    } \\
\end{align}
$$

We have equality when each term in the log is equal:

$$
q_{nk}^{(t)} \sim \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
$$

Since it is a probability, it must sum up to 1 so we have:

$$
q_{nk}^{(t)} = \frac{
    \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
}{
    \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}
}
$$
{% enddetails %}

#### Maximization step
We update the $\theta$ parameters as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
\mu_k^{(t+1)} & := \frac{\sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)} x_n}}{\sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)}}} \\

\Sigma_k^{(t+1)} & := \frac{
    \sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)} (x_n - \mu_k^{(t+1)}) (x_n - \mu_k^{(t+1)})^T}
}{
    \sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)}}
} \\

\pi_k^{(t+1)} & := \frac{1}{N}\sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)}}
\end{align}
$$


{% details Derivation %}
We had previously let $q_{nk}$ be an abstract, undefined distribution. We now freeze the $q_n^{(t)}$ assignments, and optimize over $\theta$.

In the E step, we derived a lower bound for the cost function. In general, the lower bound is not equal to the original cost. We can however carefully choose $q_{nk}$ to achieve equality. And since we want to maximize the original cost function, it makes sense to maximize this lower bound. Thus, we'll work under this locked assignment of $q_{nk}$ (thus achieving equality for the lower bound). Seeing that we have equality, our objective function (which we want to maximize) is:

$$
\prod_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K{
    q_{nk}^{(t)} 
    \log{\frac{
        \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
    }{
        q_{nk}^{(t)}
    }}
}
$$

This leads us to maximizing the expression:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K}{
    q_{nk}^{(t)} \left[
        \log{\pi_k} - \log{q_{nk}^{(t)}} + \log{\mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}
    \right]
}
$$

The $\pi_k$ should sum up to one, so we're dealing with a constrained optimization problem. We therefore add a term to turn it into an unconstrained problem. We therefore want to maximize:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K}{
    q_{nk}^{(t)} \left[
        \log{\pi_k} - \log{q_{nk}^{(t)}} + \log{\mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}
    \right] + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^K{\pi_k}
}
$$

Differentiating with respect to $\pi_k$, and setting the result to 0 yields:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N{q_{nk}^{(t)} \frac{1}{\pi_k} + \lambda} = 0
$$

Solving for $\pi_k$ gives us:

$$
\pi_k = -\frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{n=1}^N{q_{nk}^{(t)}}
$$

We can choose $\lambda$ so that this leads to a proper normalization ($\pi_k$ summing up to 1); this leads us to $\lambda = -N$. Hence, we have:

$$
\pi_k^{(t+1)} := \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N {q_{nk}^{(t)}}
$$

This is our first update rule. Let's see how to derive the others. The term $\log{\mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}$ has the form:

$$
-\frac{D}{2}\log{(2\pi)}
+\frac{1}{2}\log{\abs{\pmb{\Sigma}^{-1}}}
-\frac{1}{2}(\pmb{x} - \pmb{\mu}_k)^T\pmb{\Sigma}^{-1}(\pmb{x} - \pmb{\mu}_k)
$$

We used the fact that for an invertible matrix, $\abs{\pmb{\Sigma}} = 1/\abs{\pmb{\Sigma}^{-1}}$. Differentiating the cost function with respect to $\pmb{\mu}_k$ and setting the result to 0 yields:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N {q_{nk}^{(t)} \pmb{\Sigma}^{-1}(\pmb{x}_n - \pmb{\mu}_k)} = 0
$$

We can multiply this by $\pmb{\Sigma}$ on the left to get rid of the $\pmb{\Sigma}^{-1}$, and solve for $\pmb{\mu}_k$ to get:

$$
\pmb{\mu}_k^{(t+1)} := \frac{
    \sum_n q_{nk}^{(t)}\pmb{x}_n
}{
    \sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)}}
}
$$

Finally, for the $\Sigma$ update rule, we take the derivative with respect to $\pmb{\Sigma}_k^{-1}$ and set the result to 0, yielding:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N{q_{nk}^{(t)} \frac{1}{2} \pmb{\Sigma}^T_k}
- \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^N{q_{nk}^{(t)}(\pmb{x}_n - \pmb{\mu}_k)(\pmb{x}_n - \pmb{\mu}_k)^T}
= 0
$$

Solving for $\Sigma$ yields:

$$
\Sigma_k^{(t+1)} := \frac{
    \sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)} (x_n - \mu_k^{(t+1)}) (x_n - \mu_k^{(t+1)})^T}
}{
    \sum_n{q_{nk}^{(t)}}
}
$$

We're using the following fact, which I won't go into details to prove:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial \pmb{A}} \log{\abs{\pmb{A}}} = \pmb{A}^{-T}
$$
{% enddetails %}

#### Interpretation
The cost that we computed is indeed an expectation based on the prior $\pi_k$. Let's now take a look at the posterior distribution.

$$
p(z = k \mid x, \theta)
    = \frac{p(z=k, x \mid \theta)}{p(x\mid\theta)}
    = \frac{
        \pi_k \mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
    }{
        \sum_j{\mathcal{N}(x \mid \mu_j, \Sigma_j)}
    }
$$

This may look suspiciously familiar; in fact, it is the $q_{nk}$. The distribution that we previously just explained as an abstract, unknown distribution is in fact the posterior. If we have these posteriors, then it seems natural to optimize is the expected value of the log-likelihood of the posterior, which is exactly what we do in the E-step, as the expected value is then given by:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^N{\sum_{k=1}^K{q_{nk} \log{\pi_k \mathcal{N}(x_n \mid \mu_k, \Sigma_k)}}}
$$

We can think of the whole EM algorithm as:

$$
\theta^{(t+1)} = \argmax_{\theta}{\expectsub{p(z\mid x, \theta^{(t)})}{\log{p(z, x\mid\theta)}}}
$$

## Matrix Factorization
Matrix factorization is a form of unsupervised learning. A well-known example in which matrix factorization was used is the Netflix prize. The goal was to predict ratings of users for movies, given a very sparse matrix of ratings. We'll study the method that achieved the best error.

Let's describe the data a little more formally. Given movies $d = 1, 2, \dots, D$ and users $n = 1, 2, \dots, N$, we define $X$ as the $D\times N$ matrix containing all rating entries; that is, $x_{dn}$ is the rating of the n<sup>th</sup> user for the d<sup>th</sup> movie. We don't have any additional information on the users or on the movies, apart from the ID that's been assigned to them. In practice, the matrix was $D=20'000$ and $N=500k$, and 99.98% unobserved.

We want to give a prediction for all the unobserved entries, so that we can give the top entries (say, top 10 movies) for each user.

### Prediction using a matrix factorization
We will aim to find $\pmb{W}$ and $\pmb{Z}$ such that:

$$
\pmb{X} \sim \pmb{W}\pmb{Z}^T
$$

The hope is to "explain" each rating $x_{dn}$ by a numerical representation of the corresponding movie and user.

Here, we have $\pmb{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times K}$, forming a is a "flat matrix" $\pmb{Z}^T$, and $W\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times K}$ is a "tall matrix". The number $K$ is something that we must choose. In practice, compared to the size of $N$ or $D$, $K$ will be relatively small (maybe 50 or so).

We'll assign a cost function that we're trying to optimize:

$$
\min_{\pmb{W}, \pmb{Z}} \cost{\pmb{W}, \pmb{Z}} := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{(d, n)\in\Omega}{\left[
    x_{dn} - (\pmb{WZ}^T)_{dn}
\right]^2}
$$

Here, $\Omega\subseteq [D]\times[N]$ is given. It collects the indices of the observed ratings of the input matrix $\pmb{X}$. Our cost function here compares the number of stars $x_{dn}$ a user assigned to a movie, to the prediction of our model $\pmb{WZ}^T$, by using mean squares.

To optimize this cost function, we need to know whether it is jointly *convex* with respect to $\pmb{W}$ and $\pmb{Z}$, and whether it is *identifiable* (there is a unique minimum).

We won't go into the full proof, but the answer is the minimum is not unique. Since $\pmb{WZ}^T$ is a product, we could just divide one by 10 and multiply the other by 10 to get a different solution with the same cost.

And in fact, it's not even convex. If we think of $W$ and $Z$ as numbers (or as $1\times 1$ matrices), we can get the intuition for why this is. We could compute the Hessian, which is:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}$$

More simply though, we can just apply Jensen's inequality. The function $w\cdot z$ [looks like a saddle function](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=xy), and just isn't convex. 

### Choosing K
$K$ is the number of *latent features*. This is comparable to the K we chose in K-means, defining the number of clusters. Large values of K facilitate overfitting.

### Regularization
We can add a regularizer and minimize the following cost:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \sum_{(d, n)\in\Omega}{\left[
    x_{dn} - (\pmb{WZ}^T)_{dn}
\right]^2} 
    + \frac{\lambda_w}{2}\norm{\pmb{W}}^2_{\text{Frob}}
    + \frac{\lambda_z}{2}\norm{\pmb{Z}}^2_{\text{Frob}}
$$

With scalars $\lambda_w, \lambda_z > 0$.

### Stochastic gradient descent 
With our cost functions in place, we can look at our standard algorithm for minimization. We'll define loss as a sum of many individual loss functions:

$$
\sum_{(d, n)\in\Omega}{f_{dn}} 
= \sum_{(d, n)\in\Omega}{\frac{1}{2}\left[
    x_{dn} - (\pmb{WZ}^T)_{dn}
\right]^2}
$$

Let's derive the stochastic gradient for an individual loss function (which is what we need to compute when doing SGD). When doing gradients by a matrix, we expect to find a matrix again. Let's just look at the dimensions of what we're computing:

$$
\nabla_W  f_{dn} \in \mathbb{R}^{D\times K} \\
\nabla_Z  f_{dn} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times K}
$$

For a fixed pair $(d, n)$, we will compute a single entry $(d', k)$ in $\pmb{W}$:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial w_{d', k}} f_{d, n}(\pmb{W}, \pmb{Z})
= \begin{cases}
    - \left[x_{dn} - (\pmb{WZ}^T)_{dn} \right] z_{n, k} & \text{if } d' = d \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

The same goes for the derivative by $\pmb{Z}$. We'll compute a single entry $(n', k)$ in the $\pmb{Z}$ derivative:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial z_{n', k}} f_{d, n}(\pmb{W}, \pmb{Z})
= \begin{cases}
    - \left[x_{dn} - (\pmb{WZ}^T)_{dn} \right] w_{d, k} & \text{if } n' = n \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

It turns out that computing this is very cheap; $\mathcal{O}(K)$. This is the greatest advantage of using SGD for this. There are no guarantees that this works though; this is still an open research question. But in practice, it works really well. 

The update step is then:

$$
W^{(t+1)} = W^{(t)} - \gamma \nabla_W f_{dn} \\
Z^{(t+1)} = Z^{(t)} - \gamma \nabla_Z f_{dn} \\
$$

We only update the d<sup>th</sup> row of W, and the n<sup>th</sup> row of Z.

### Alternating least squares (ALS)
The alternate minimization algorithm alternates between optimizing $\pmb{Z}$ and $\pmb{W}$. ALS is a special case of this, with square error.

#### No missing entries
For simplicity, let's just assume that there are no missing entries in the data matrix, that is $\Omega = [D]\times[N]$ (instead of $\subseteq$). This makes our life a little easier, and we'll be able to find a closed form solution (indeed, if $\Omega$ is the whole set, the problem is pretty easy to solve; if it's an arbitrary subset, it becomes a NP-hard problem). Our cost is then:

$$
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{d=1}^D\sum_{n=1}^N \left[
    x_{dn} - (\pmb{WZ}^T)_{dn}
\right]^2 + \lambda_W \frobnorm{\pmb{W}}^2 + \lambda_Z \frobnorm{\pmb{Z}}^2 \\
= \frac{1}{2}\frobnorm{\pmb{X} - \pmb{WZ}^T}^2 + \lambda_W \frobnorm{\pmb{W}}^2 + \lambda_Z \frobnorm{\pmb{Z}}^2
$$

ALS then does a **coordinate descent** to minimize the cost (plus a regularizer). First, we fix $\pmb{W}$ and compute the minimum with respect to $\pmb{Z}$ (we ignore the other regularizer, as minimization is the same with or without an added constant):

$$
\min_{\pmb{Z}}{\frac{1}{2}\frobnorm{\pmb{X} - \pmb{WZ}^T}^2} + \lambda_Z \frobnorm{\pmb{Z}}^2
$$

Then, we alternate, minimizing $\pmb{W}$ and fixing $\pmb{Z}$: 

$$
\min_{\pmb{W}}{\frac{1}{2}\frobnorm{\pmb{X} - \pmb{WZ}^T}^2} + \lambda_W \frobnorm{\pmb{W}}^2
$$

The update rule is thus given by:

$$
(\pmb{Z}^*)^T := (\pmb{W}^T \pmb{W} + \lambda_Z \pmb{I}_K)^{-1} \pmb{W}^T \pmb{X} \\
(\pmb{W}^*)^T := (\pmb{Z}^T \pmb{Z} + \lambda_W \pmb{I}_K)^{-1} \pmb{Z}^T \pmb{X} \\
$$

Note that the regularization helps us make sure that problem indeed is invertible (since we're adding an identity matrix). Note that we can find a closed form solution if we don't have any missing entries. We do this by taking the derivative, and setting it to zero. The cost of finding the solution is then per column, $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(D)$, which is not quite as good as the $\mathcal{O}(K)$ with SGD. Still, it's not too bad: we're only inverting a $K\times K$ matrix, which is much nicer than dealing with D or N. Also note that there is no step size to tune, which makes it easier to deal with (although this approach is slower)

#### Missing entries
As before, we can derive the ALS updates for the more general setting, where we only have certain ratings $(d, n)\in\Omega$. The idea is to compute the gradient with respect to each group of variables, and set it to zero.

### Text representation learning

#### Motivation
We can't plug string-encoded words directly into our learning models. Can we find a meaningful numerical representation for all of our data? We'd like to find a mapping, or **embedding**, for each word $w_i$:

$$
w_i \mapsto \pmb{w}_i \in \mathbb{R}^K
$$

The naive, first approach would be to pick $K$ to be the size of the vocabulary; we can then encode words as one-hot vectors. This works nicely, but has high dimensionality, and cannot capture the order of the words (which is why it's also called the "bag of words" approach).

But we can do this in smarter way. The idea is to pick a much lower $K$, and try to group semantically similar words in this K-dimensional space.

#### Co-occurrence matrix 
To attempt to get the meaning of words, we can construct co-occurrence count from a big corpus or text. This is a matrix in which $n_{ij}$ is the number of contexts where word $w_i$ occurs together with word $w_j$. A context is a window of words occurring together (it could be a document, paragraph, sentence, or a window of $n$ words). 

For a vocabulary $\nu = \set{w_1, \dots, w_D}$ and context words $w_n = 1, 2, \dots N$, the co-occurrence matrix is a very sparse $D\times N$.


#### Learning word representations
To construct a word embedding, we want to find a factorization of the co-occurrence matrix. This typically uses the log of the actual counts, i.e. $x_{dn} := \log{(n_{dn})}$. We'll find a factorization s.t:

$$
\pmb{X} \approx \pmb{WZ}^T
$$

For each pair of words $(w_d, w_n)$, we'll try to explain their co-occurrence count by a numerical representation of the two words; $\pmb{W}$ is the representation of a word, while $\pmb{Z}$ is the representation of a context word.

The GloVe embedding (an alternative to word2vec) uses a little trick to give importance to each entry. It computes a weight $f_{dn}$ according to the following function:

$$
f_{dn} = \min\set{1, \left(\frac{n_{dn}}{ n_{\text{max}} }\right)^\alpha},
\quad \alpha\in[0, 1]
$$

We can also choose $f_{dn} := 1$ if we don't want to weigh the vectors, but GloVe achieves good results with this choice. For $K$, we can just choose a value, say 50, 100 or 200. Trial and error will serve us well. We can train the factorization with SGD or ALS.

#### Skip-gram model 
This model uses binary classification to separate real word pairs $(w_d, w_n)$, appearing together in a context window, from fake world pairs, sampled randomly.

#### FastText
This is another matrix factorization approach to learn classify documents. It combines bag of words and.

A sentence can be represented as $\pmb{x}_n \in\mathbb{R}^{\abs{\nu}}$, a vector that is 1 in the position of its words. We try to optimize over the following cost function.

$$
\min_{\pmb{W}, \pmb{Z}} \cost{\pmb{W}, \pmb{Z}} := \sum f(y_n \pmb{WZ}^T\pmb{x}_n)
$$

Where:

- $\pmb{W}\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times K}$ and $\pmb{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{\abs{\nu}\times k}$ are the factorization
- $x_n\in\mathbb{R}^{\abs{\nu}}$ is the n<sup>th</sup> training sentence.
- $f$ is a linear classifier loss function
- $y_n\in\set{\pm 1}$ is the classification label for sentence $x_n$

## SVD and PCA

### Motivation
**Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction method. There are two properties that we get from PCA.

- It can be used to *compress data* from $D$ dimensions to $K$ dimensions, with $K \le D$. For machine learning, it's often best not to compress data in this manner, but it can be necessary in certain situations (for reasons of interpretability for example)
- It gives us a *linear transformation* that decorrelates the data; it finds $K$ new features from the initial $D$

The PCA will be computed from the data matrix $\pmb{X}$ using **singular value decomposition** (SVD).

### SVD
The SVD decomposition of a $D \times N$ matrix $\pmb{X}$ is:

$$
\pmb{X} = \pmb{USV}^T
$$

In the following, we assume $D < N$, but it is still true when that is not the case (we could just take the transpose)

- $\pmb{U}$ is a $D \times D$ orthonormal[^orthonormal] matrix
- $\pmb{V}$ is a $N \times N$ orthonormal[^orthonormal] matrix
- $\pmb{S}$ is a $D\times N$ diagonal matrix (with $D$ diagonal entries)

[^orthonormal]: The columns of an orthonormal matrix are orthogonal and unitary (they have have norm 1). The transpose is equal to the inverse, meaning that if $\pmb{U}$ is orthogonal, then $\pmb{U}^T\pmb{U} = \pmb{UU}^T = \pmb{I}$

One useful property about unitary matrices (like $\pmb{U}$ and $\pmb{V}$, which are orthonormal, a stronger claim) is that they preserve the norms (they don't change the length of the vectors being transformed), meaning that we can think of them as a rotation. A small proof of this follows:

$$
\frobnorm{\pmb{Ux}}^2 = \pmb{x}^T\pmb{U}^T\pmb{Ux} = \pmb{x}^T\pmb{I}\pmb{x} = \frobnorm{\pmb{x}}^2 
$$

The diagonal entries in $\pmb{S}$ are the *singular values* in descending order: $s_1 \ge s_2 \ge \dots \ge s_D \ge 0$. The columns of $\pmb{U}$ and $\pmb{V}$ are the *left* and *right singular vectors*.

#### Dimensionality reduction
Suppose we want to compress a $D\times N$ data matrix $\pmb{X}$ to a $K\times N$ matrix $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$, where $1 \le K \le D$. We'll define this transformation from $\pmb{X}$ to $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$ by the $K\times D$ compression matrix $\pmb{C}$. The decompression (or reconstruction) from $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$ to $\pmb{X}$ is $\pmb{R}$.

Can we find good matrices? Our criteria is that the error introduced when compressing and reconstructing should be small, over all choices of compression and reconstruction matrices:

$$
\frobnorm{\pmb{X} - \pmb{R}\pmb{C}\pmb{X}}^2
$$

There are other ways of measuring the quality of a compression and reconstruction, but for the sake of simplicity, we'll stick to this one. 

We can actually place a bound on the reconstruction error using the following lemma.

***

**Lemma**: For any $D \times N$ matrix $\pmb{X}$ and any $D\times N$ rank-K matrix $\pmb{X}$:

$$
\frobnorm{\pmb{X} - \hat{\pmb{X}}}^2 \ge \frobnorm{\pmb{X} - \pmb{U}_K \pmb{U}_K^T \pmb{X}} = \sum_{i \ge K+1}{s_i^2}
$$

Where $\pmb{X} = \pmb{U}\pmb{S}\pmb{V}^T$ is the SVD of decomposition, and $s_i$ are the singular values of $\pmb{X}$, and $\pmb{U}_K$ is the $D\times K$ matrix of the first $K$ rows of $\pmb{U}$. 

This lemma tells us that if we use $\pmb{C} = \pmb{U}_K^T$ as our compression matrix, and $\pmb{R} = \pmb{U}_K$ as the reconstruction matrix, then we achieve an error that is better or equal to any other choice of reconstruction $\hat{\pmb{X}}$.

Note that the reconstruction error is the sum of the singular values after the cut-off $K$; intuitively, we can think of the error as coming from the singular values we ignored. 

***

Using this, we've managed to compress down to $K$ dimensions, and we see that we're actually fairly close in terms of reconstruction error.

This fact really defines PCA. This lemma tells us that all the most important information about $\pmb{X}$ is contained in the K left-most singular vectors, the K first columns of $\pmb{U}$.

The term $\pmb{U}_K \pmb{U}_K^T \pmb{X}$ has another simple interpretation. Let $S^{(K)}$ be the $D\times N$ diagonal matrix corresponding to a truncated version of $S$. It is of the same size, but only has the K first diagonal values of S, and is zero everywhere else. We claim that:

$$
\pmb{U}_K \pmb{U}_K^T \pmb{X} = \pmb{U}_K \pmb{U}_K^T \pmb{USV}^T = \pmb{US}^{(K)}\pmb{V}^T
$$

> 👉🏼 It's okay to drop the K subscript on the U matrix because $\pmb{S}^{(K)}$ already takes care of selecting the first K rows

This tells us that the *best* rank K approximation of a matrix is obtained by computing its SVD, and truncating it at K (i.e., setting all the singular values at position $j \ge K + 1$ to zero).

#### SVD and matrix factorization
Expressing $\pmb{X}$ as an SVD decomposition allows us to easily get a matrix factorization.

$$
\pmb{X} 
= \pmb{USV}^T 
= \underbrace{\pmb{U}}_{\pmb{W}} \underbrace{\pmb{SV}^T}_{Z^T} 
= WZ^T
$$

This is clearly a special case of the matrix factorization as we saw it previously. There are two differences from the general case. One of the nice things about this approach is that we don't need to pre-select the rank K from the start. We can control it at any time later, and let it range from 1 to $\min(D, N)$. 

As we've discussed, this is the *best* rank K approximation that we can find, as the Frobenius norm of the difference (between the approximation and the true value) is the smallest possible (sum of the squares of the singular values).

We can also just pre-choose our value K and compute the matrix factorization that defines our dimensionality reduction:

$$
\pmb{X}_K 
= \pmb{U}_K \pmb{S}^{(K)} \pmb{V}^T 
= \underbrace{\pmb{U}_K}_{\pmb{W}}
  \underbrace{\pmb{S}^{(K)}\pmb{V}^T}_{Z^T} 
= \pmb{W}\pmb{Z}^T 
$$

Note however that the SVD approach doesn't allow us to deal with incomplete data matrices.

### PCA and decorrelation
Assume that we have N D-dimensional points in a $D\times N$ matrix $\pmb{X}$. We can compute the empirical mean and co-variance by:

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{\pmb{x}} & = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N {x_n} \\
\pmb{K} & = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N (\pmb{x}_n - \bar{\pmb{x}}) (\pmb{x}_n - \bar{\pmb{x}})^T
\end{align}
$$

The correlation matrix $\pmb{K}$ is a $D \times D$ rank-1 matrix. If our data is from i.i.d. samples then these empirical values will converge to the true values when $N \rightarrow \infty$.

Before we do PCA, we need to center the data around the mean. Let's assume our data matrix $\pmb{X}$ has been pre-processed as such. Using the SVD, we can rewrite the empirical covariance matrix as: 

$$
N\pmb{K} 
= \sum_{n=1}^N {(\pmb{x}_n \pmb{x}_n^T)} 
= \pmb{X}\pmb{X}^T 
= \pmb{U}\pmb{S}\pmb{V}^T \pmb{V}\pmb{S}^T \pmb{U}^T 
= \pmb{U}\pmb{S}\pmb{S}^T \pmb{U}^T 
= \pmb{U}\pmb{S}_D^2 \pmb{U}^T
$$

This works because $\pmb{V}$ is an orthogonal matrix, so $\pmb{V}^T\pmb{V} = I_N$, and $\pmb{S}$ is diagonal, so $\pmb{SS}^T = S_D^2$, where $S_D^2$ is a $D\times D$ diagonal matrix consisting of the D first columns of $\pmb{S}$.

Let's try this again, but this time considering the transformed data $\tilde{\pmb{X}} = \pmb{U}_K^T\pmb{X}$. Remember that PCA finds orthogonal axes that represent the most variance (with the origin at the mean). Starting with orthogonal axes, it finds the rotation $\pmb{U}^T$ so that the axes point in the direction of maximum variance. The empirical covariance of along this transformed axis is:

$$
N \tilde{\pmb{K}} = \tilde{\pmb{X}} \tilde{\pmb{X}}^T = \pmb{U}^T\pmb{X}\pmb{X}^T\pmb{U} = \pmb{U}^T\pmb{US}_D^2\pmb{U}^T\pmb{U} = \pmb{S}_D^2
$$

Here, the empirical co-variance is *diagonal*. This means that through PCA, we've transformed our data to make the various components **uncorrelated**. This gives us some intuition of why it may be useful to first transform the data with the rotation $\pmb{U}^T\pmb{X}$.

Additionally, by the definition of PCA, the singular values are in decreasing order (so the first one, $s_1$, is the greatest one). Since we have a diagonal matrix as our empirical variance, it means that the variance of the first component is $s_1^2$, which proves the property of PCA's axes being in decreasing order of variance.

Assume that we're doing classification. Intuitively, it makes sense that classifying features with a larger variance would be easier (when the variance is 0, all data is the same and it becomes impossible to classify using that component). From this point of view, it makes intuitive sense to only keep the first K rows of $\tilde{\pmb{X}}$ when we perform dimensionality reduction; we keep the features that have high variance and are uncorrelated, and we discard all features with variance close to 0 as they're hard to classify.

### Computing the SVD efficiently
To compute the SVD decomposition of a matrix $\pmb{X}$, we must compute the matrices $\pmb{U}$ and $\pmb{S}$ Let's see how we can do this efficiently. 

Let's consider the $D\times D$ matrix $\pmb{XX}^T$. As before, since $\pmb{V}$ is orthogonal, we can use the SVD decomposition to get:

$$
\pmb{XX}^T = \pmb{USS}^T\pmb{U}^T = \pmb{U} \pmb{S}_D^2 \pmb{U}^T
$$


Let $\pmb{u}_j$ denote the j<sup>th</sup> column of $\pmb{U}$.

$$
\pmb{XX}^T \pmb{u}_j = \pmb{U}\pmb{S}_D^2 \pmb{U}^T \pmb{u}_j = s_j^2 \pmb{u}_j
$$

We see that the the j<sup>th</sup> column of $\pmb{U}$ is the j<sup>th</sup> eigenvector of $\pmb{XX}^T$, with eigenvalue $s_j^2$. Therefore, finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for $\pmb{XX}^T$ gives us a way to compute $\pmb{U}$ and $\pmb{S}$.

There's a subtle point to be made here about the sign of the eigenvector. If $\pmb{u}_j$ is an eigenvector, then so is $-\pmb{u}_j$. But if our goal is simply to use that decomposition to do PCA, then it doesn't matter as the sign of the columns of $U_K^T$ disappear when computing $\pmb{U}_K\pmb{U}_K^T$. However, if the goal is simply to do SVD, we must fix some choice of signs, and be consistent in $\pmb{V}$.

To compute this decomposition, we can either work with $\pmb{X}^T\pmb{X}$ or $\pmb{XX}^T$. This is practical, as it allows us to pick the smaller of the two and work in dimension D or N.

### Pitfalls of PCA
Unfortunately, PCA is no miracle cure. The SVD is not invariant under scalings of the features in the original matrix $\pmb{X}$. This is why it's so important to normalize features. But there are many ways of doing this, and the result of PCA is highly dependent on how we do this, and there is a large degree of arbitrariness. Still, the conventional approach for PCA is to remove the mean and normalize the variance to 1.

## Neural Networks
### Structure
As always in supervised learning, we start with a dataset $S_{\text{train}} = \set{(x_n, y_n)}$, with $x_n \in\mathbb{R}^D$.

Let's take a look at a simple multilayer perceptron neural network. It has an **input layer** of size $D$ (one for each dimension of the data), $L$ hidden layers of size $K$, and one output layer, which we'll simply consider to be .

A neuron takes a weighted sum of all the neurons in the previous layer plus a bias term, and takes a non-linear function of that result. For instance, the value of neuron $j$ at layer $l$ is given by: 

$$
x_j^{(l)} = \phi\left( \sum_{i=1}^K w_{i, j}^{(l)} x_i^{(l - 1)} + b_j^{(l)} \right)
$$

This $\phi$ function is called the activation function. It's very important that this is non-linear; otherwise, the whole neural net's global function is just a linear function, which defeats the idea of having a complicated, layered function.

A typical choice for this function is the sigmoid function:

$$
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$

The layered structured of our neural net means that there are $K^2 L$ parameters.

### How powerful are NNs? 
This chapter somewhat follows [Chapter 4 of Nielsen's book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html). See that for a more in-depth explanation of this argument.

We'll state the following lemma without proof. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, where its Fourier transform is: 

$$
\tilde{f}(w) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^D} {f(\pmb{x}) e^{-j\omega^T\pmb{x}}} d\pmb{x}
$$

We also assume that:

$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^D} {\abs{\omega} \abs{\tilde{f}(\omega)}} d\omega \le C
$$

Essentially, these assumptions just say that our function is "sufficiently smooth" (the $C$ has to do with the smoothness; as long as it is real, the function can be shown to be continuously differentiable). Then, for all $n \ge 1$, there exists a function $f_n$ of the form:

$$
f_n(x) = \sum_{j=1}^n {x_j \phi(\pmb{x}^T\pmb{w}_j + b_j)} + c_0
$$

This is a function that is representable by a NN with one hidden layer with $n$ nodes and "sigmoid-like" activation functions (this is more general than just sigmoid, but includes sigmoid) such that:

$$
\int_{\abs{\pmb{x}} \le r} {(f(\pmb{x}) - f_n(\pmb{x}))^2} d\pmb{x}
\le
\frac{(2Cr)^2}{n}
$$

This tells us that the error goes down with a rate of $\frac{1}{n}$. Note that this only guarantees us a good approximation in a ball of radius $r$ around the center. The larger the bounded domain, the more nodes we'll need to approximate a function to the same level (the upper bound grows in terms of $r^2$).

In fact, we'll see that if we have enough nodes in the network, then we can approximate the underlying distribution function. There is no limit, and no real lower bounds, but we do have the property that neural nets have significant expressive power provided that they're large enough; we'll give an intuitive explanation of this below.

If we think of a scalar function $f(x)$ on a bounded domain, so it is Riemann integrable, meaning that it can be approximated arbitrarily precisely (with error at most $\epsilon$, with $\epsilon > 0$) by "upper" and "lower" sums of rectangles.

![Riemann integrals of a function](/images/ml/riemann.png)

If we don't limit the weights in our NN, with a single hidden layer consisting of two hidden nodes, we can construct a function which is arbitrarily close to a given rectangle. As we've just said, a finite number of rectangles is enough to approximate the function arbitrarily closely. It follows that with a finite number of hidden nodes of a NN with one hidden layer, we can approximate any such function arbitrarily closely.

This discussion generalizes to functions that are $\mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. See Nielsen book and lecture notes.

Note that doing the Riemann integral is rarely, if ever, the best way to approximate a function. We wouldn't want to approximate a smooth function with horrible squares. The argument here isn't that this is an efficient approach, just that NNs are *capable* of doing this.

The same argument also holds under other activation functions. For instance, let's try to work it out with the rectified linear unit (ReLu) function:

$$
(x)_+ = \max\set{0, x}
$$

Let $f(x)$ be the function we're trying to approximate. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem tells us that for every $\epsilon > 0$, there's a polynomial $p(x)$ locally approximating it arbitrarily precisely; that is, for all $x\in[0, 1]$, we have:

$$
\abs{f(x) - p(x)} < \epsilon
$$

This function $f(x)$ can also be approximated in $L_\infty$ norm by piecewise linear function of the form:

$$
q(x) = \sum_{i=1}^m (a_i x + b_i) \mathbb{I}_{\set{r_{i-1} \le x < r_i}}
$$

Where $0 = r_0 < r_1 < \dots < r_m = 1$ is a suitable partition of $[0, 1]$. This continuity imposes the constraint:

$$
a_i r_i + b_i = a_{i+1}r_i + b_{i+1}, \quad i = 1, \dots, m-1
$$

This allows us to rewrite the $q(x)$ function as follows:

$$
q(x) = \tilde{a_1} x + \tilde{b_1} + \sum_{i = 2}^m{\tilde{a_i}(x - \tilde{b_i})_+}
$$

Where:

$$
\begin{align}
\widetilde{a_1} & = a_1\\
\widetilde{a_2} & = a_2 - a_1 \\
            & \vdots \\
a_i & = \sum_{j=1}^m{\widetilde{a_i}} \\ \\

\widetilde{b_i} & = r_i - 1 \\
\end{align}
$$

### Popular activation functions

The sigmoid function $\phi(x)$ has a domain of $[0, 1]$. The main problem with sigmoid is the gradient for large values of $x$, which goes very close to zero. This is known as the "vanishing gradient problem", which may make learning slow.

$$
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
$$

The hyperbolic tangent has a domain of $[-1, 1]$. It suffers from the same "vanishing gradient problem".

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} = 2\phi(2x) - 1
$$

ReLu is a very popular choice, and is what works best in most cases.

Leaky ReLu solves the 0-derivative problem of ReLu by adding a very small slope $\alpha$ (a hyper-parameter that can be optimized) for negative values:

$$
f(x) = \max{\set{\alpha x, x}}
$$

Finally, maxout is a generalization of ReLu. Again, the constants can be optimized. Note that this is quite different from previous cases, where we computed the activation function of a weighted sum. Here, we compute $k \ge 2$ different weighted sums, and then choose the maximum. 

$$
f(x) = \max{\set{x^T w_1 + b_1, \dots, x^T w_k + b_k}}
$$

### SGD and Backpropagation
Remember that the value of every neuron is computed by:

$$
x_j^{(l)} = \phi\left( \sum_{i=1}^K w_{i, j}^{(l)} x_i^{(l - 1)} + b_j^{(l)} \right)
$$

We'd like to optimize this process. Let's assume that we want to do a regression. Let's denote the output of the neural net by the function $f$. Our cost function would then simply be:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{n=1}^N{(y_n - f(\pmb{x}_n))^2}
$$

We'll omit regularization for the simplicity of our explanation, but it can trivially be added in, without loss of generality. To optimize our cost, we'd like to do a gradient descent. Let's do a stochastic gradient descent on a single data point. We need to compute the derivative of the cost of this single point, which is:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_n}{\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}},
\qquad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_n}{\partial b_j^{(l)}}
$$

We can gain a more general formula by restating the problem in vector form. Generally, a layer of neurons is computed by:

$$
\pmb{x}^{(l)} 
= f^{(l)}(\pmb{x}^{(l - 1)}) 
= \phi\left(
    \left(\pmb{W}^{(l)}\right)^T \pmb{x}^{(l - 1)} + \pmb{b}^{(l)}
\right)
$$

The overall function of the neural net is thus something taking the input layer $\pmb{x}^{(0)}$

$$
f(\pmb{x}^{(0)}) = f^{(L+1)} \circ \dots \circ f^{(2)} \circ f^{(1)}(\pmb{x}^{(0)})
$$

To make things more convenient, we'll introduce notation for the linear part of the computation of a layer. The computation below corresponds to our **forward pass**.

$$
\begin{align}
\pmb{z}^{(l)} & = \left(\pmb{W}^{(l)}\right)^T \pmb{x}^{(l - 1)} + \pmb{b}^{(l)} \\
\pmb{x}^{(l)} & = \phi(\pmb{z}^{(l)})
\end{align}
$$

To be formal, we'll just quickly state that our notation here means that we're applying $\phi$ component-wise. We see that to compute a $\pmb{x}^{(l)}$, we need $\pmb{x}^{(l - 1)}$; we therefore need to start from the input layer and compute our way forward, until the last layer, which is why this is called the forward path.

Note that the full chain of computation that gets us to the output it $\mathcal{O}(K^2 L)$, which is not too bad.

For the **backwards pass**, let's remember that the cost of a single data-point is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_n = (y_n - f^{(L+1)} \circ \dots \circ f^{(2)} \circ f^{(1)}(\pmb{x}^{(0)}))^2
$$

we'll want to compute the following, which is a derivative over both $\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}$ and $\partial b_j^{(l)}$.

$$
\begin{align}
\delta_j^{(l)} 
& = \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_n}{\partial z_j^{(l)}} \\
& = \sum_k 
    \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_n}{\partial z_k^{(l+1)}}
    \frac{\partial z_k^{(l+1)}}{\partial z_j^{(l)}}  \\
& = \sum_k \delta_k^{(l+1)} \pmb{W}_{i, j}^{(l+1)}
\end{align}
$$

We can write this more compactly using $\odot$, which is the [Hadamard product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)) (element-wise multiplication of vectors):

$$
\delta^{(l)} = (\pmb{W}^{(l+1)} \delta^{(l+1)}) \odot \phi'(\pmb{z}^{(l)})
$$

Here, to compute a $\delta^{(l)}$, we need $\delta^{(l+1)}$; we must therefore start from the output, and compute our way back to layer 0, which is why we call this a backwards pass.

Now that we have both $\pmb{z}^{(l)}$ and $\delta^{(l)}$, let's go back to our initial goal, which is to compute the following:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_n}{\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}}

= \sum_k 
    \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_n}{\partial z_k^{(l)}}
    \frac{\partial z_k^{(l)}}{\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}}

= \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}_n}{\partial z_k^{(l)}}
  \frac{\partial z_k^{(l)}}{\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}}

= \delta_j^{(l)} \pmb{x}_i^{(l - 1)}
$$

We were able re-express this as a product of these elements that we already have. We were able to drop the sum because changing a single weight $w_{i, j}^{(l)}$ *only* changes the single sum $z_j$; all other sums stay unchanged, and therefore do not enter into the derivative with respect to $w_{i, j}^{(l)}$. In other words, the term $\frac{\partial z_k^{(l)}}{\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}}$ is only non-zero when $j=k$.

We've thus found the result of the two derivatives we wanted to originally find:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_n}{\partial w_{i, j}^{(l)}}
= \delta_j^{(l)} \pmb{x}_i^{(l - 1)},
\qquad
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_n}{\partial b_j^{(l)}}
= \delta_j^{(l)}
$$
